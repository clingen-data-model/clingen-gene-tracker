Variants in NF1 were first reported in humans with this disease as early as 1990 (Wallace et al., PMID 2134734). Diagnosis of Neurofibromatous Type 1 is based on criteria established by the NIH (1988; PMID 3152465). At least 3000 unique germline variants have been identified (reviewed in Gutmann et al., 2017; PMID 28230061). This gene-disease relationship is well-known and therefore a significant amount of case-level data, segregation data and experimental data is available in the literature, therefore the maximum score for both genetic evidence and experimental evidence has been reached.  Note, this curation effort may not be exhaustive of all literature related to this gene-disease relationship. In particular, earlier compelling evidence suggestive of the gene-disease relationship, such as linkage data, may not be reflected in the current curation. The mechanism for disease is likely loss of function as NF1 encodes neurofibromin, which regulates cell growth and survival through downstream signaling pathways and loss of nuerofibromin is predicted to lead to increased cell growth (reviewed in Gutmann et al., 2017; PMID 28230061). Of note, this gene has also been implicated in familial spinal Neurofibromatosis, Neurofibromatosis-Noonan syndrome, Watson syndrome and juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (AD). NF1 patients with features more consistent with Noonan syndrome in addition to Neurofibromatosis Type 1 have been described as having Neurofibromatosis-Noonan syndrome (Baralle et al., 2003; PMID 12707950, De Luca et al., 2005; PMID 16380919, Stevenson et al., 2006; PMID 16542390, Chen et\nal., 2014; PMID 25049390). However, after further review of the phenotypes described in these patients, the ClinGen RASopathy Expert Panel has decided that these presentations are consistent with what would be expected in patients with NF1 Neurofibromatosis Type 1. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found no difference in molecular mechanism, inheritance pattern, or phenotypic variability for the disease entities mentioned and therefore they have been lumped into one disease entity, Neurofibromatosis Type 1. In summary, NF1 is definitively associated with autosomal dominant Neurofibromatosis Type 1. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.

Neurofibromatosis is characterized by cafe-au-lait spots, Lisch nodules, and fibromatous tumors of the skin. At least 3000 unique germline variants have been identified (reviewed in Gutmann et al., 2017; PMID 28230061).

Of note, this gene has also been implicated in familial spinal Neurofibromatosis, Neurofibromatosis-Noonan syndrome, Watson syndrome and juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (AD).

type 1 (NF1) is one of the most common autosomal dominant disorders and is caused by mutations in the NF1 gene. Mutation detection is complex due to the large size of the NF1 gene, the presence of pseudogenes and the great variety of possible lesions. Although there is no evidence for locus heterogeneity in NF1, mutation detection rates rarely exceed 50%. We studied 67 unrelated NF1 patients fulfilling the NIH diagnostic criteria, 29 familial and 38 sporadic cases, using a cascade of complementary techniques. We performed a protein truncation test starting from puromycin-treated EBV cell lines and, if no mutation was found, continued with heteroduplex, FISH, Southern blot and cytogenetic analysis. We identified the germline mutation in 64 of 67 patients and 32 of the mutations are novel. This is the highest mutation detection rate reported in a study of typical NF1 patients. All mutations were studied at the genomic and RNA level. The mutational spectrum consisted of 25 nonsense, 12 frameshift, 19 splice mutations, six missense and/or small in-frame deletions, one deletion of the entire NF1 gene, and a translocation t(14;17)(q32;q11.2). Our data suggest that exons 10a-10c and 37 are mutation-rich regions and that together with some recurrent mutations they may account for almost 30% of the mutations in classical NF1 patients. We found a high frequency of unusual splice mutations outside of the AG/GT 5 cent and 3 cent splice sites. As some of these mutations form stable transcripts, it remains possible that a truncated neurofibromin is formed.","uuid":"c4e33412-a5e0-49cc-a6ab-46632b319b88","authors":["Messiaen LM","Callens T","Mortier G","Beysen D","Vandenbroucke I","Van Roy N","Speleman F","Paepe AD"],"journal":"Human mutation","schema_version":"1","title":"Exhaustive mutation analysis of the NF1 gene allows identification of 95% of mutations and reveals a high frequency of unusual splicing defects."}],"is_proband":"Yes","ageType":"Report","date_created":"2017-11-30T01:31:51.642938+00:00","countryOfOrigin":"Japan","ageValue":63,"associatedFamilies":[],"diagnosis":[{"phenotypes":[],"submitted_by":"/users/ac57e92b-f144-4b03-9d34-5c24b317e155/","status":"in progress","last_modified":"2019-05-04T00:37:43.458764+00:00","modified_by":"/users/ac57e92b-f144-4b03-9d34-5c24b317e155/","synonyms":["neurofibromatosis type 1 microdeletion syndrome","Von Recklinghausen disease","neurofibromatosis type 1","NF1","peripheral neurofibromatosis","von Reklinghausen disease","neurofibromatosis","neurofibromatosis 1","neurofibromatosis, type 1"],"date_created":"2019-05-04T00:37:43.458736+00:00","term":"neurofibromatosis type 1","diseaseId":"MONDO_0018975","@type":["disease","item"],"description":"Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a clinically heterogeneous, neurocutaneous genetic disorder characterized by cafe-au-lait spots, iris Lisch nodules, axillary and inguinal freckling, and multiple neurofibromas.","@id":"/diseases/7751e7bf-ae59-4d8c-af8b-4e6582902bad/","associatedFamilies":["/families/2155aa84-d844-44eb-a7dd-b6e775ccfdd3/"],"uuid":"7751e7bf-ae59-4d8c-af8b-4e6582902bad","associatedIndividuals":["/individuals/3775bce0-efc9-4b85-81af-99870ff8a5e9/","/individuals/4cf7e5d3-8a7f-405e-842c-ce4b1e0bf4d6/","/individuals/0880e61e-cde2-4361-b8f9-580dc4ccdbed/","/individuals/b0ec3f7d-f1cd-4de4-b35e-f4b7d015d3cc/","/individuals/50dd8da5-ef6e-44ec-9749-0b013baca9c0/","/individuals/488982c3-4c69-4ce2-b0ef-f4f814bb3cbf/","/individuals/4d1e03d8-7e9b-4051-9d9d-c4bc8f2ab0f4/","/individuals/ae09add9-7fa2-40da-b856-77abd7495542/","/individuals/1ffb801a-5a22-46c2-ac1c-3dc075d2a119/","/individuals/da60906a-a08a-47b6-8312-f5e4daec9262/"],"associatedGroups":["/groups/a44cd2a4-096b-4513-844b-79e0c8a85a7d/","/groups/65312a75-5ec7-4a96-8ed7-0005184470de/"],"associatedInterpretations":[],"schema_version":"2","associatedGdm":["/gdm/b414c555-e01c-4198-b7dc-6569ffe68deb/"]}],"ageUnit":"Years","assessment_count":0,"proband":true,"method":{"genomeWideStudy":false,"previousTestingDescription":"","previousTesting":false,"additionalInformation":"","dateTime":"2019-02-26T08:50:34-05:00","specificMutationsGenotypedMethod":"Next gen sequencing (109 genes), direct capillary sequencing","genotypingMethods":[]},"status":"in progress","scores":[{"scoreStatus":"Score","submitted_by":{"last_name":"McGlaughon","user_status":"active","email":"jennifer.mcglaughon@gmail.com","uuid":"84a6e93b-5075-4dfb-9de5-a9fcde89abc9","title":"Jen McGlaughon","affiliation":["10003","10008","10009","10010","10011","10023","10026","10049"],"@type":["user","item"],"date_created":"2017-01-05T08:00:00+00:00","@id":"/users/84a6e93b-5075-4dfb-9de5-a9fcde89abc9/","first_name":"Jen","lab":"/labs/curator/"},"status":"in progress","score":1,"affiliation":"10026","caseControl_scored":[],"evidenceType":"Individual","@type":["evidenceScore","item"],"@id":"/evidencescore/2a8271e3-5dc1-4855-8233-747913e9a0ad/","date_created":"2019-02-26T13:50:34.745706+00:00","modified_by":{"last_name":"Wright","user_status":"active","email":"wrightmw@stanford.edu","uuid":"c0a70214-08a8-48a0-ba8d-521bed321d4a","title":"Matt Wright","affiliation":["10006","10005","10009","10011","10018","10019","10007","10034","10048","10049","10003","10042","10021","10012","10013","10014","10057","10058","10059","10060","10061","10062","10015","10023","10016","10008","10026"],"@type":["user","item"],"date_created":"2016-11-04T07:00:00+00:00","@id":"/users/c0a70214-08a8-48a0-ba8d-521bed321d4a/","first_name":"Matt","lab":"/labs/curator/"},"scoreExplanation":"Experimental studies have shown that this sequence change affects splicing and causes skipping of 62 nucleotides in exon 13 (PMID: 11258625, 10543400, 10607834).","calculatedScore":0.5,"uuid":"2a8271e3-5dc1-4855-8233-747913e9a0ad","experimental_scored":[],"evidenceScored":"1ffb801a-5a22-46c2-ac1c-3dc075d2a119","individual_scored":["/individuals/1ffb801a-5a22-46c2-ac1c-3dc075d2a119/"],"last_modified":"2019-03-01T14:29:51.600693+00:00","caseInfoType":"OTHER_VARIANT_TYPE_WITH_GENE_IMPACT","schema_version":"2"}],"affiliation":"10026","additionalInformation":"From Invitae: Experimental studies have shown that this sequence change affects splicing and causes skipping of 62 nucleotides in exon 13 (referred to as exon 10b in the literature).

Mutation analysis in the NF-1 gene is complicated by the large size of the gene, the high mutation rate, and the presence of pseudogenes. By means of the polymerase chain reaction, we have amplified 70% of the NF-1 coding sequence using reverse transcribed mRNA and genomic DNA from 25 unrelated Scottish Caucasian patients. We have used chemical mismatch cleavage analysis and direct sequencing of asymmetrically amplifed PCR products to characterise mutations within the NF-1 gene. Using the above strategy, we detected 10 novel mutations and an intragenic polymorphism with a heterozygosity of approximately 47% in the Scottish population. Of the 10 mutations, 7 are potentially disease causing. They include splice site errors responsible for exon skipping (1721 + 3A to G) and (5749 + 2T to G), small insertions (7485insGG) and (6519insG), a nonsense mutation (R2496X), and missense and silent mutations (G1166D, K1419R, G1404G, S1311S, N1776N). A correlation of the phenotype with the genotype is presented. Thus, in this study we have identified a heterogeneous group of germline mutations, the majority of which are predicted to cause disruption of the protein product, neurofibromin. This approach has therefore proved to be useful for the detection of mutations in the gene for neurofibromatosis type-1, and can be applied to detection of molecular pathologies in general.","uuid":"8c599d10-e836-4d3e-8c3d-aca49ce9899c","authors":["Purandare SM","Lanyon WG","Connor JM"],"journal":"Human molecular genetics","schema_version":"1","title":"Characterisation of

The requirement for a permissive haploinsufficient environment to allow tumorigenesis may have therapeutic implications for NF1 and other familial cancers.","uuid":"bb55d625-ec84-4b60-af10-9ef6045271b1","authors":["Zhu Y","Ghosh P","Charnay P","Burns DK","Parada LF"],"journal":"Science (New York, N.Y.)","schema_version":"1","title":"Neurofibromas in NF1: Schwann cell origin and role of tumor environment."},"individuals":[],"last_modified":"2019-03-01T14:29:51.785964+00:00","schema_version":"4","associatedGdm":["/gdm/b414c555-e01c-4198-b7dc-6569ffe68deb/"]},{"number_group":"","submitted_by":{"last_name":"McGlaughon","user_status":"active","email":"jennifer.mcglaughon@gmail.com","uuid":"84a6e93b-5075-4dfb-9de5-a9fcde89abc9","title":"Jen McGlaughon","affiliation":["10003","10008","10009","10010","10011","10023","10026","10049"],"@type":["user","item"],"date_created":"2017-01-05T08:00:00+00:00","@id":"/users/84a6e93b-5075-4dfb-9de5-a9fcde89abc9/","first_name":"Jen","lab":"/labs/curator/"},"active":true,"affiliation":"10026","modified_by":"/users/c0a70214-08a8-48a0-ba8d-521bed321d4a/","date_created":"2017-11-30T17:58:52.238656+00:00","@type":["annotation","item"],"families":[],"status":"in progress","experimentalData":[{"submitted_by":{"last_name":"McGlaughon","user_status":"active","email":"jennifer.mcglaughon@gmail.com","uuid":"84a6e93b-5075-4dfb-9de5-a9fcde89abc9","title":"Jen McGlaughon","affiliation":["10003","10008","10009","10010","10011","10023","10026","10049"],"@type":["user","item"],"date_created":"2017-01-05T08:00:00+00:00","@id":"/users/84a6e93b-5075-4dfb-9de5-a9fcde89abc9/","first_name":"Jen","lab":"/labs/curator/"},"active":true,"last_modified":"2019-03-01T14:29:51.870295+00:00","date_created":"2017-11-30T18:34:21.032700+00:00","proteinInteractions":{},"assessments":[],"functionalAlteration":{"descriptionOfGeneAlteration":"Used siRNA to knock down NF1 in primary human melanocytes.","nonPatientCells":"CL_0000148","normalFunctionOfGene":"GO:0043473","functionalAlterationType":"Non-patient cells","evidenceForNormalFunction":"Knock down of NF1 induced a senescence-like morphology of the melanocytes compared to controls.

The molecular mechanisms involved in CALMs formation remain largely unknown. In this report, we show for the first time pathophysiological mechanisms of abnormal melanocyte differentiation in a human NF1(+/-) -induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-based model. We demonstrate that NF1 patient-derived fibroblasts can be successfully reprogrammed in NF1(+/-) iPSCs with active RAS signaling and that NF1 loss induces senescence during melanocyte differentiation as well as in patient's-derived CALMs, revealing a new role for NF1 in the melanocyte lineage.","uuid":"55848e7d-9be6-4478-b96d-6fde19456efb","authors":["Larribere L","Wu H","Novak D","Galach

cells  induced morphological changes such as excessive actin stress fiber formation, elevated phosphorylated levels of cofilin, which regulates actin cytoskeletal reorganization.

These results show that depletion of NF1 alters actin cytoskeleton reorganization and promotes cell motility, invasiveness, and cell-cell adhesion, leading to formation of large cell aggregates.

Neurofibromin (NF1) gene mutations lead to increased risk of neurofibromas, schwannomas, low grade, pilocytic optic pathway gliomas, as well as malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors and glioblastomas. Despite the evidence for NF1 tumor suppressor function in glial cell tumors, the mechanisms underlying transformation remain poorly understood. In this report, we used morpholinos to knockdown the two nf1 orthologs in zebrafish and show that oligodendrocyte progenitor cell (OPC) numbers are increased in the developing spinal cord, whereas neurons are unaffected. The increased OPC numbers in nf1 morphants resulted from increased proliferation, as detected by increased BrdU labeling, whereas TUNEL staining for apoptotic cells was unaffected. This phenotype could be rescued by the forced expression of the GTPase-activating protein (GAP)-related domain of human NF1. In addition, the in vivo analysis of OPC migration following nf1 loss using time-lapse microscopy demonstrated that olig2-EGFP(+) OPCs exhibit enhanced cell migration within the developing spinal cord. OPCs pause intermittently as they migrate, and in nf1 knockdown animals, they covered greater distances due to a decrease in average pause duration, rather than an increase in velocity while in motion.

Neurofibromin (NF1) gene mutations lead to increased risk of neurofibromas, schwannomas, low grade, pilocytic optic pathway gliomas, as well as malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors and glioblastomas. Despite the evidence for NF1 tumor suppressor function in glial cell tumors, the mechanisms underlying transformation remain poorly understood. In this report, we used morpholinos to knockdown the two nf1 orthologs in zebrafish and show that oligodendrocyte progenitor cell (OPC) numbers are increased in the developing spinal cord, whereas neurons are unaffected. The increased OPC numbers in nf1 morphants resulted from increased proliferation, as detected by increased BrdU labeling, whereas TUNEL staining for apoptotic cells was unaffected. This phenotype could be rescued by the forced expression of the GTPase-activating protein (GAP)-related domain of human NF1. In addition, the in vivo analysis of OPC migration following nf1 loss using time-lapse microscopy demonstrated that olig2-EGFP(+) OPCs exhibit enhanced cell migration within the developing spinal cord. OPCs pause intermittently as they migrate, and in nf1 knockdown animals, they covered greater distances due to a decrease in average pause duration, rather than an increase in velocity while in motion. Interestingly, nf1 knockdown also leads to an increase in ERK signaling, principally in the neurons of the spinal cord. Together, these results show that negative regulation of the Ras pathway through the GAP activity of NF1 limits OPC proliferation and motility during development, providing insight into the oncogenic mechanisms through which NF1 loss contributes to human glial tumors.","uuid":"274b3104-cd0e-47ce-8c0c-85618f8b0856","authors":["Lee JS","Padmanabhan A","Shin J","Zhu S","Guo F","Kanki JP","Epstein JA","Look AT"],"journal":"Human molecular genetics","schema_version":"1","title":"Oligodendrocyte progenitor cell numbers and migration are regulated by the zebrafish orthologs of the NF1 tumor suppressor gene."},"individuals":[],"last_modified":"2019-03-01T14:29:52.284278+00:00","schema_version":"4","associatedGdm":["/gdm/b414c555-e01c-4198-b7dc-6569ffe68deb/"]},{"number_group":"","submitted_by":{"last_name":"McGlaughon","user_status":"active","email":"jennifer.mcglaughon@gmail.com","uuid":"84a6e93b-5075-4dfb-9de5-a9fcde89abc9","title":"Jen McGlaughon","affiliation":["10003","10008","10009","10010","10011","10023","10026","10049"],"@type":["user","item"],"date_created":"2017-01-05T08:00:00+00:00","@id":"/users/84a6e93b-5075-4dfb-9de5-a9fcde89abc9/","first_name":"Jen","lab":"/labs/curator/"},"active":true,"affiliation":"10026","modified_by":"/users/c0a70214-08a8-48a0-ba8d-521bed321d4a/","date_created":"2019-02-26T14:54:10.232541+00:00","@type":["annotation","item"],"families":[],"status":"in progress","experimentalData":[],"number_family":"","@id":"/evidence/3c7c849a-7c46-438c-945d-3ed3168b3ab3/","number_individual":1,"uuid":"3c7c849a-7c46-438c-945d-3ed3168b3ab3","number_experimental":"","groups":[],"article":{"submitted_by":{"last_name":"McGlaughon","user_status":"active","email":"jennifer.mcglaughon@gmail.com","uuid":"84a6e93b-5075-4dfb-9de5-a9fcde89abc9","title":"Jen McGlaughon","affiliation":["10003","10008","10009","10010","10011","10023","10026","10049"],"@type":["user","item"],"date_created":"2017-01-05T08:00:00+00:00","@id":"/users/84a6e93b-5075-4dfb-9de5-a9fcde89abc9/","first_name":"Jen","lab":"/labs/curator/"},"active":true,"pmid":"21354044","last_modified":"2019-02-26T14:54:10.076176+00:00","doi":"","date_created":"2019-02-26T14:54:10.076521+00:00","@type":["article","item"],"date":"2011 Mar;13(2):113-22.","modified_by":"/users/84a6e93b-5075-4dfb-9de5-a9fcde89abc9/","pmcid":"","@id":"/articles/21354044/","abstract":"Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a hereditary disorder caused by mutations in the NF1 gene.

Berg","publishDate":"2020-05-11T19:54:36.113Z","evidenceSummary":"The relationship between NF1 and Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (autosomal dominant) was evaluated using the ClinGen Clinical Validity Framework as of February 26th, 2019. Variants in NF1 were first reported in humans with this disease as early as 1990 (Wallace et al., PMID 2134734). Diagnosis of Neurofibromatous Type 1 is based on criteria established by the NIH (1988; PMID 3152465). At least 3000 unique germline variants have been identified (reviewed in Gutmann et al., 2017; PMID 28230061). This gene-disease relationship is well-known and therefore a significant amount of case-level data, segregation data and experimental data is available in the literature, therefore the maximum score for both genetic evidence and experimental evidence has been reached.  Note, this curation effort may not be exhaustive of all literature related to this gene-disease relationship. In particular, earlier compelling evidence suggestive of the gene-disease relationship, such as linkage data, may not be reflected in the current curation. The mechanism for disease is likely loss of function as NF1 encodes neurofibromin, which regulates cell growth and survival through downstream signaling pathways and loss of nuerofibromin is predicted to lead to increased cell growth (reviewed in Gutmann et al., 2017; PMID 28230061). Of note, this gene has also been implicated in familial spinal Neurofibromatosis, Neurofibromatosis-Noonan syndrome, Watson syndrome and juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (AD). NF1 patients with features more consistent with Noonan syndrome in addition to Neurofibromatosis Type 1 have been described as having Neurofibromatosis-Noonan syndrome (Baralle et al., 2003; PMID 12707950, De Luca et al., 2005; PMID 16380919, Stevenson et al., 2006; PMID 16542390, Chen et\nal., 2014; PMID 25049390). However, after further review of the phenotypes described in these patients, the ClinGen RASopathy Expert Panel has decided that these presentations are consistent with what would be expected in patients with NF1 Neurofibromatosis Type 1. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found no difference in molecular mechanism, inheritance pattern, or phenotypic variability for the disease entities mentioned and therefore they have been lumped into one disease entity, Neurofibromatosis Type 1. In summary, NF1 is definitively associated with autosomal dominant Neurofibromatosis Type 1. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen General Gene Curation Expert Panel on February 27, 2019.","reasons":"","@type":["provisionalClassification","item"],"contradictingEvidence":{"caseControl":false,"proband":false,"experimental":false},"provisionalDate":"2020-05-11T19:53:03.576Z","classificationContributors":["10018"],"publishAffiliation":"40026","@id":"/provisional/367a3958-ce81-47fa-a505-a451ca67aab5/","uuid":"367a3958-ce81-47fa-a505-a451ca67aab5","provisionalSubmitter":"Courtney Thaxton","alteredClassification":"No Modification","approvedClassification":true,"provisionalReviewDate":"2019-03-05T17:00:00.000Z","schema_version":"11","provisionedClassification":true},"associatedSnapshot":"/snapshots/b37e74d2-2f18-47ae-accf-34059f5b602b/","resourceId":"367a3958-ce81-47fa-a505-a451ca67aab5","schema_version":"2"}
