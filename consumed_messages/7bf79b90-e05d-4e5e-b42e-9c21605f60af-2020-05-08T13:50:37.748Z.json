Cutaneous phenotypes including woolly hair and/or keratoderma can present along with the cardiomyopathy, but are noted as less penetrant features.","synonyms":["wooly hair-palmoplantar keratoderma-dilated cardiomyopathy syndrome","wooly hair-palmoplantar hyperkeratosis-dilated cardiomyopathy syndrome","DCWHK","keratoderma with woolly hair type II","KWWH type II","dilated cardiomyopathy with woolly hair and keratoderma","woolly hair-palmoplantar hyperkeratosis-dilated cardiomyopathy syndrome","Carvajal syndrome","palmoplantar keratoderma with left ventricular cardiomyopathy and woolly hair"],"date_created":"2020-04-10T17:15:40.998477+00:00","associatedIndividuals":["/individuals/1bd314dc-a410-4029-bf62-721f2db52b51/","/individuals/36ce5b70-9bcb-4777-b2d7-a2fa735e57ea/","/individuals/58f59b65-4030-436a-8356-98f79328c795/","/individuals/d209d04a-09e4-4f7f-8219-fc1c4024b7ba/","/individuals/4e0325f3-1a68-49bd-b3b6-a8fd93d5365f/"],"@id":"/diseases/70aa27aa-13c7-4f29-9b76-e992f67983b9/","status":"in progress","associatedInterpretations":[],"associatedGroups":[],"associatedFamilies":["/families/a85fa5ff-25b6-4bd8-bd2c-d951b46b1f2f/"],"@type":["disease","item"],"schema_version":"2","last_modified":"2020-04-10T17:15:41.000861+00:00","uuid":"70aa27aa-13c7-4f29-9b76-e992f67983b9","modified_by":"/users/f41a40ab-cb17-4bcf-b4ae-8901490dbb06/","term":"arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy with woolly hair and keratoderma","diseaseId":"MONDO_0011581","phenotypes":[],"associatedGdm":["/gdm/0683943f-da80-4a3c-8f9f-454d59040eb2/"]}],"schema_version":"7","scores":[{"submitted_by":{"uuid":"4e0331c5-0a0a-4298-8f2d-f370b2fb0664","first_name":"Kathleen","lab":"/labs/curator/","date_created":"2017-02-02T08:00:00+00:00","user_status":"active","affiliation":["10008","10010","10011","10018"],"title":"Kathleen Wallace","last_name":"Wallace","@id":"/users/4e0331c5-0a0a-4298-8f2d-f370b2fb0664/","@type":["user","item"],"email":"kathleen_wallace@med.unc.edu"},"uuid":"1defd330-2bcd-4db7-901f-409e48eda967","caseInfoType":"PREDICTED_OR_PROVEN_NULL_VARIANT","date_created":"2018-07-13T01:12:54.683056+00:00","affiliation":"10003","@id":"/evidencescore/1defd330-2bcd-4db7-901f-409e48eda967/","scoreStatus":"Score","caseControl_scored":[],"status":"in progress","calculatedScore":1.5,"@type":["evidenceScore","item"],"individual_scored":["/individuals/1bd314dc-a410-4029-bf62-721f2db52b51/"],"modified_by":{"uuid":"4e0331c5-0a0a-4298-8f2d-f370b2fb0664","first_name":"Kathleen","lab":"/labs/curator/","date_created":"2017-02-02T08:00:00+00:00","user_status":"active","affiliation":["10008","10010","10011","10018"],"title":"Kathleen Wallace","last_name":"Wallace","@id":"/users/4e0331c5-0a0a-4298-8f2d-f370b2fb0664/","@type":["user","item"],"email":"kathleen_wallace@med.unc.edu"},"schema_version":"2","experimental_scored":[],"evidenceType":"Individual","last_modified":"2018-07-13T01:12:54.683045+00:00"}],"@type":["individual","item"],"last_modified":"2018-07-13T01:12:54.849103+00:00","ageUnit":"","date_created":"2018-07-13T01:12:54.849348+00:00","@id":"/individuals/1bd314dc-a410-4029-bf62-721f2db52b51/","sex":"Unknown","status":"in progress","associatedAnnotations":[{"submitted_by":"/users/044be67a-626c-42dc-8727-4d068d42e967/","uuid":"67d74522-f93d-4407-8d82-e3ad3f2b5c38","date_created":"2018-06-05T11:32:10.394071+00:00","number_family":"","affiliation":"10003","individuals":["/individuals/b36b86ed-83a0-428c-b3e2-c64a055055c3/","/individuals/b2125ea6-453f-4021-ba22-8c874a6a1fb7/","/individuals/a4867f48-1a11-45e4-8f58-0a1b52d0eb5e/","/individuals/9066ec20-20ec-41bd-9636-3446a8a70775/","/individuals/ed6a8a70-72bb-4a1a-9c0b-3f2161539ccf/","/individuals/07b69917-6479-439d-ba0c-a554924a141b/","/individuals/1bd314dc-a410-4029-bf62-721f2db52b51/","/individuals/36ce5b70-9bcb-4777-b2d7-a2fa735e57ea/","/individuals/4e0325f3-1a68-49bd-b3b6-a8fd93d5365f/"],"@id":"/evidence/67d74522-f93d-4407-8d82-e3ad3f2b5c38/","groups":[],"status":"in progress","modified_by":"/users/4e0331c5-0a0a-4298-8f2d-f370b2fb0664/","families":[],"@type":["annotation","item"],"number_group":"","schema_version":"4","number_experimental":"","active":true,"article":{"submitted_by":"/users/044be67a-626c-42dc-8727-4d068d42e967/","uuid":"bd904bc5-2893-4730-8d7e-51c49afc80ef","active":true,"date_created":"2018-06-05T11:32:10.095037+00:00","journal":"International journal of cardiology","title":"Desmoplakin missense and non-missense mutations in arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy: Genotype-phenotype correlation.","@id":"/articles/28527814/","abstract":"Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) is traditionally considered as primarily affecting the right ventricle.

Cutaneous phenotypes including woolly hair and/or keratoderma can present along with the cardiomyopathy, but are noted as less penetrant features.","synonyms":["wooly hair-palmoplantar keratoderma-dilated cardiomyopathy syndrome","wooly hair-palmoplantar hyperkeratosis-dilated cardiomyopathy syndrome","DCWHK","keratoderma with woolly hair type II","KWWH type II","dilated cardiomyopathy with woolly hair and keratoderma","woolly hair-palmoplantar hyperkeratosis-dilated cardiomyopathy syndrome","Carvajal syndrome","palmoplantar keratoderma with left ventricular cardiomyopathy and woolly hair"],"date_created":"2020-04-10T17:15:40.998477+00:00","associatedIndividuals":["/individuals/1bd314dc-a410-4029-bf62-721f2db52b51/","/individuals/36ce5b70-9bcb-4777-b2d7-a2fa735e57ea/","/individuals/58f59b65-4030-436a-8356-98f79328c795/","/individuals/d209d04a-09e4-4f7f-8219-fc1c4024b7ba/","/individuals/4e0325f3-1a68-49bd-b3b6-a8fd93d5365f/"],"@id":"/diseases/70aa27aa-13c7-4f29-9b76-e992f67983b9/","status":"in progress","associatedInterpretations":[],"associatedGroups":[],"associatedFamilies":["/families/a85fa5ff-25b6-4bd8-bd2c-d951b46b1f2f/"],"@type":["disease","item"],"schema_version":"2","last_modified":"2020-04-10T17:15:41.000861+00:00","uuid":"70aa27aa-13c7-4f29-9b76-e992f67983b9","modified_by":"/users/f41a40ab-cb17-4bcf-b4ae-8901490dbb06/","term":"arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy with woolly hair and keratoderma","diseaseId":"MONDO_0011581","phenotypes":[],"associatedGdm":["/gdm/0683943f-da80-4a3c-8f9f-454d59040eb2/"]}],"schema_version":"7","scores":[{"submitted_by":{"uuid":"4e0331c5-0a0a-4298-8f2d-f370b2fb0664","first_name":"Kathleen","lab":"/labs/curator/","date_created":"2017-02-02T08:00:00+00:00","user_status":"active","affiliation":["10008","10010","10011","10018"],"title":"Kathleen Wallace","last_name":"Wallace","@id":"/users/4e0331c5-0a0a-4298-8f2d-f370b2fb0664/","@type":["user","item"],"email":"kathleen_wallace@med.unc.edu"},"uuid":"b85af25f-8574-48e7-99ac-63e6d5fe48dd","caseInfoType":"PREDICTED_OR_PROVEN_NULL_VARIANT","date_created":"2018-07-13T01:17:06.526722+00:00","affiliation":"10003","@id":"/evidencescore/b85af25f-8574-48e7-99ac-63e6d5fe48dd/","scoreStatus":"Score","caseControl_scored":[],"status":"in progress","calculatedScore":1.5,"@type":["evidenceScore","item"],"individual_scored":["/individuals/36ce5b70-9bcb-4777-b2d7-a2fa735e57ea/"],"modified_by":{"uuid":"4e0331c5-0a0a-4298-8f2d-f370b2fb0664","first_name":"Kathleen","lab":"/labs/curator/","date_created":"2017-02-02T08:00:00+00:00","user_status":"active","affiliation":["10008","10010","10011","10018"],"title":"Kathleen Wallace","last_name":"Wallace","@id":"/users/4e0331c5-0a0a-4298-8f2d-f370b2fb0664/","@type":["user","item"],"email":"kathleen_wallace@med.unc.edu"},"schema_version":"2","experimental_scored":[],"evidenceType":"Individual","last_modified":"2018-07-13T01:17:06.526474+00:00"}],"@type":["individual","item"],"termsInDiagnosis":"repolarization abnormalities, global or regional dysfunction and structural alterations","last_modified":"2018-07-13T01:17:06.683448+00:00","ageUnit":"","date_created":"2018-07-13T01:17:06.683458+00:00","@id":"/individuals/36ce5b70-9bcb-4777-b2d7-a2fa735e57ea/","sex":"Unknown","status":"in progress","associatedAnnotations":[{"submitted_by":"/users/044be67a-626c-42dc-8727-4d068d42e967/","uuid":"67d74522-f93d-4407-8d82-e3ad3f2b5c38","date_created":"2018-06-05T11:32:10.394071+00:00","number_family":"","affiliation":"10003","individuals":["/individuals/b36b86ed-83a0-428c-b3e2-c64a055055c3/","/individuals/b2125ea6-453f-4021-ba22-8c874a6a1fb7/","/individuals/a4867f48-1a11-45e4-8f58-0a1b52d0eb5e/","/individuals/9066ec20-20ec-41bd-9636-3446a8a70775/","/individuals/ed6a8a70-72bb-4a1a-9c0b-3f2161539ccf/","/individuals/07b69917-6479-439d-ba0c-a554924a141b/","/individuals/1bd314dc-a410-4029-bf62-721f2db52b51/","/individuals/36ce5b70-9bcb-4777-b2d7-a2fa735e57ea/","/individuals/4e0325f3-1a68-49bd-b3b6-a8fd93d5365f/"],"@id":"/evidence/67d74522-f93d-4407-8d82-e3ad3f2b5c38/","groups":[],"status":"in progress","modified_by":"/users/4e0331c5-0a0a-4298-8f2d-f370b2fb0664/","families":[],"@type":["annotation","item"],"number_group":"","schema_version":"4","number_experimental":"","active":true,"article":{"submitted_by":"/users/044be67a-626c-42dc-8727-4d068d42e967/","uuid":"bd904bc5-2893-4730-8d7e-51c49afc80ef","active":true,"date_created":"2018-06-05T11:32:10.095037+00:00","journal":"International journal of cardiology","title":"Desmoplakin missense and non-missense mutations in arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy: Genotype-phenotype correlation.","@id":"/articles/28527814/","abstract":"Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) is traditionally considered as primarily affecting the right ventricle.

Cutaneous phenotypes including woolly hair and/or keratoderma can present along with the cardiomyopathy, but are noted as less penetrant features.","synonyms":["wooly hair-palmoplantar keratoderma-dilated cardiomyopathy syndrome","wooly hair-palmoplantar hyperkeratosis-dilated cardiomyopathy syndrome","DCWHK","keratoderma with woolly hair type II","KWWH type II","dilated cardiomyopathy with woolly hair and keratoderma","woolly hair-palmoplantar hyperkeratosis-dilated cardiomyopathy syndrome","Carvajal syndrome","palmoplantar keratoderma with left ventricular cardiomyopathy and woolly hair"],"date_created":"2020-04-10T17:15:40.998477+00:00","associatedIndividuals":["/individuals/1bd314dc-a410-4029-bf62-721f2db52b51/","/individuals/36ce5b70-9bcb-4777-b2d7-a2fa735e57ea/","/individuals/58f59b65-4030-436a-8356-98f79328c795/","/individuals/d209d04a-09e4-4f7f-8219-fc1c4024b7ba/","/individuals/4e0325f3-1a68-49bd-b3b6-a8fd93d5365f/"],"@id":"/diseases/70aa27aa-13c7-4f29-9b76-e992f67983b9/","status":"in progress","associatedInterpretations":[],"associatedGroups":[],"associatedFamilies":["/families/a85fa5ff-25b6-4bd8-bd2c-d951b46b1f2f/"],"@type":["disease","item"],"schema_version":"2","last_modified":"2020-04-10T17:15:41.000861+00:00","uuid":"70aa27aa-13c7-4f29-9b76-e992f67983b9","modified_by":"/users/f41a40ab-cb17-4bcf-b4ae-8901490dbb06/","term":"arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy with woolly hair and keratoderma","diseaseId":"MONDO_0011581","phenotypes":[],"associatedGdm":["/gdm/0683943f-da80-4a3c-8f9f-454d59040eb2/"]}],"schema_version":"7","scores":[{"submitted_by":{"uuid":"4e0331c5-0a0a-4298-8f2d-f370b2fb0664","first_name":"Kathleen","lab":"/labs/curator/","date_created":"2017-02-02T08:00:00+00:00","user_status":"active","affiliation":["10008","10010","10011","10018"],"title":"Kathleen Wallace","last_name":"Wallace","@id":"/users/4e0331c5-0a0a-4298-8f2d-f370b2fb0664/","@type":["user","item"],"email":"kathleen_wallace@med.unc.edu"},"uuid":"5b2a78f5-1453-4db0-a5b2-2e1e0813b88b","caseInfoType":"PREDICTED_OR_PROVEN_NULL_VARIANT","date_created":"2018-07-13T01:22:00.958532+00:00","affiliation":"10003","@id":"/evidencescore/5b2a78f5-1453-4db0-a5b2-2e1e0813b88b/","scoreStatus":"Score","caseControl_scored":[],"status":"in progress","calculatedScore":1.5,"@type":["evidenceScore","item"],"individual_scored":["/individuals/4e0325f3-1a68-49bd-b3b6-a8fd93d5365f/"],"modified_by":{"uuid":"4e0331c5-0a0a-4298-8f2d-f370b2fb0664","first_name":"Kathleen","lab":"/labs/curator/","date_created":"2017-02-02T08:00:00+00:00","user_status":"active","affiliation":["10008","10010","10011","10018"],"title":"Kathleen Wallace","last_name":"Wallace","@id":"/users/4e0331c5-0a0a-4298-8f2d-f370b2fb0664/","@type":["user","item"],"email":"kathleen_wallace@med.unc.edu"},"schema_version":"2","experimental_scored":[],"evidenceType":"Individual","last_modified":"2018-07-13T01:22:00.958289+00:00"}],"@type":["individual","item"],"termsInDiagnosis":"repolarization abnormalities, global or regional dysfunction and structural alterations","last_modified":"2018-07-13T01:22:01.242462+00:00","ageUnit":"","date_created":"2018-07-13T01:22:01.242471+00:00","@id":"/individuals/4e0325f3-1a68-49bd-b3b6-a8fd93d5365f/","sex":"Unknown","status":"in progress","associatedAnnotations":[{"submitted_by":"/users/044be67a-626c-42dc-8727-4d068d42e967/","uuid":"67d74522-f93d-4407-8d82-e3ad3f2b5c38","date_created":"2018-06-05T11:32:10.394071+00:00","number_family":"","affiliation":"10003","individuals":["/individuals/b36b86ed-83a0-428c-b3e2-c64a055055c3/","/individuals/b2125ea6-453f-4021-ba22-8c874a6a1fb7/","/individuals/a4867f48-1a11-45e4-8f58-0a1b52d0eb5e/","/individuals/9066ec20-20ec-41bd-9636-3446a8a70775/","/individuals/ed6a8a70-72bb-4a1a-9c0b-3f2161539ccf/","/individuals/07b69917-6479-439d-ba0c-a554924a141b/","/individuals/1bd314dc-a410-4029-bf62-721f2db52b51/","/individuals/36ce5b70-9bcb-4777-b2d7-a2fa735e57ea/","/individuals/4e0325f3-1a68-49bd-b3b6-a8fd93d5365f/"],"@id":"/evidence/67d74522-f93d-4407-8d82-e3ad3f2b5c38/","groups":[],"status":"in progress","modified_by":"/users/4e0331c5-0a0a-4298-8f2d-f370b2fb0664/","families":[],"@type":["annotation","item"],"number_group":"","schema_version":"4","number_experimental":"","active":true,"article":{"submitted_by":"/users/044be67a-626c-42dc-8727-4d068d42e967/","uuid":"bd904bc5-2893-4730-8d7e-51c49afc80ef","active":true,"date_created":"2018-06-05T11:32:10.095037+00:00","journal":"International journal of cardiology","title":"Desmoplakin missense and non-missense mutations in arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy: Genotype-phenotype correlation.","@id":"/articles/28527814/","abstract":"Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) is traditionally considered as primarily affecting the right ventricle.

Cutaneous phenotypes including woolly hair and/or keratoderma can present along with the cardiomyopathy, but are noted as less penetrant features.","synonyms":["wooly hair-palmoplantar

Here, we report on a genome scan in one Italian family in which the disease appeared unlinked to any of the six different ARVD loci reported so far; we identify a mutation (S299R) in exon 7 of desmoplakin (DSP), which modifies a putative phosphorylation site in the N-terminal domain binding plakoglobin. It is interesting that a nonsense DSP mutation was reported elsewhere in the literature, inherited as a recessive trait and causing a biventricular dilative cardiomyopathy associated with palmoplantar keratoderma and woolly hairs. Therefore, different DSP mutations might produce different clinical phenotypes, with different modes of inheritance.","authors":["Rampazzo A","Nava A","Malacrida S","Beffagna G","Bauce B","Rossi V","Zimbello R","Simionati B","Basso C","Thiene G","Towbin JA","Danieli GA"],"pmid":"12373648","@type":["article","item"],"doi":"","schema_version":"1","date":"2002 Nov;71(5):1200-6.","last_modified":"2018-06-05T11:45:09.323810+00:00","modified_by":"/users/044be67a-626c-42dc-8727-4d068d42e967/","pmcid":""},"associatedGdm":[{"submitted_by":"/users/c99732e2-67d8-4e50-859d-e8ff21f0d08b/","uuid":"0683943f-da80-4a3c-8f9f-454d59040eb2","affiliation":"10003","number_pathogenicity":"3","provisionalClassifications":["/provisional/b23da580-269c-4e5d-8f13-91dbe7ea6a57/"],"variantPathogenicity":["/pathogenicity/a754270c-f371-462f-a8cc-9891c51ec171/","/pathogenicity/221ec44f-9148-4eab-92f5-708fe06dfac8/","/pathogenicity/7cbc30d1-1bb8-41bf-b84a-23ff06a5c898/"],"gdm_title":"DSP-70aa27aa-13c7-4f29-9b76-e992f67983b9-0","schema_version":"8","gene":{"uuid":"59123c96-97f0-4ca9-8024-b7b33843f048","entrezId":"1832","previousSymbols":[],"hgncStatus":"Approved","name":"desmoplakin","symbol":"DSP","@id":"/genes/DSP/","previousNames":["desmoplakin (DPI, DPII)"],"chromosome":"6p24.3","status":"current","@type":["gene","item"],"locusType":"gene with protein product","schema_version":"1","omimIds":["125647"],"synonyms":["KPPS2","PPKS2","DPI","DPII"],"hgncId":"HGNC:3052","nameSynonyms":[],"pmids":["1889810"]},"gdm_status":"Summary/Provisional Classifications","annotations":["/evidence/67d74522-f93d-4407-8d82-e3ad3f2b5c38/","/evidence/a5e496b4-86b8-4d91-840f-c645080b9970/","/evidence/a5cefb81-fd47-4591-a329-b562e60a4c14/","/evidence/91889764-c9cc-4bd5-9bbc-40a13ab40a79/","/evidence/56b7231f-beb9-4e79-8498-434b0faf4855/"],"last_modified":"2018-07-13T03:19:44.169592+00:00","draftClassification":"","modeInheritance":"Autosomal dominant inheritance (HP:0000006)","date_created":"2018-05-14T07:57:45.077911+00:00","disease":{"submitted_by":"/users/f41a40ab-cb17-4bcf-b4ae-8901490dbb06/","description":"Arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy with woolly hair and keratoderma is often associated with the gene DSP, encoding desmoplakin.

Desmoplakin is part of all desmosomes, which are abundantly expressed in both myocardial and epidermal tissue and serve as intercellular mechanical junctions. This study aimed to investigate protein expression in myocardial and epidermal tissue of ARVC and CS patients carrying DSP mutations in order to elucidate potential molecular disease mechanisms. Genetic investigations identified three ARVC patients carrying different heterozygous DSP mutations in addition to a homozygous DSP mutation in a CS patient. The protein expression of DSP in mutation carriers was evaluated in biopsies from myocardial and epidermal tissue by immunohistochemistry. Keratinocyte cultures were established from skin biopsies of mutation carriers and characterized by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, western blotting, and protein mass spectrometry. The results showed that the mutation carriers had abnormal DSP expression in both myocardial and epidermal tissue. The investigations revealed that the disease mechanisms varied accordingly to the specific types of DSP mutation identified and included haploinsufficiency, dominant-negative effects, or a combination hereof. Furthermore, the results suggest that the keratinocytes cultured from patients are a valuable and easily accessible resource to elucidate the effects of desmosomal gene mutations in humans.","authors":["Rasmussen TB","Hansen J","Nissen PH","Palmfeldt J","Dalager S","Jensen UB","Kim WY","Heickendorff L","M\u00f8lgaard H","Jensen HK","S\u00f8rensen KE","Baandrup UT","Bross P","Mogensen J"],"pmid":"23137101","@type":["article","item"],"doi":"","schema_version":"1","date":"2013 Jul;84(1):20-30.","last_modified":"2018-06-05T11:49:44.059890+00:00","modified_by":"/users/044be67a-626c-42dc-8727-4d068d42e967/","pmcid":""},"associatedGdm":["/gdm/0683943f-da80-4a3c-8f9f-454d59040eb2/"],"experimentalData":[{"submitted_by":{"uuid":"044be67a-626c-42dc-8727-4d068d42e967","first_name":"Babken","lab":"/labs/curator/","date_created":"2018-03-20T07:00:00+00:00","user_status":"active","affiliation":["10003","10035"],"title":"Babken Asatryan","last_name":"Asatryan","@id":"/users/044be67a-626c-42dc-8727-4d068d42e967/","@type":["user","item"],"email":"babken.asatryan@students.unibe.ch"},"uuid":"c92cb4a0-76e9-4969-be69-af9cb3ee882e","proteinInteractions":{},"label":"Immunohistochemistry","affiliation":"10003","functionalAlteration":{},"expression":{"organOfTissueFreeText":"heart, myocardium","normalExpression":{},"alteredExpression":{"evidence":"The amount of the c.3805C>T DSP1 transcript was investigated by quantitative RT-PCR.\nMean DSP1/DSP1+2 expression ratio was significantly reduced by 28% in mutant cells.

In summary, these findings were in accordance with the results of RT-PCR and suggested that the DSP-p.R1269X mutation was likely to cause DSP1 haploinsufficiency.","evidenceInPaper":"Text, section 'Family 2 \u2013 DSP-p.R1269X', Figure 4","expressedInPatients":false},"organOfTissue":["UBERON:0002349"]},"schema_version":"8","scores":[{"submitted_by":{"uuid":"044be67a-626c-42dc-8727-4d068d42e967","first_name":"Babken","lab":"/labs/curator/","date_created":"2018-03-20T07:00:00+00:00","user_status":"active","affiliation":["10003","10035"],"title":"Babken Asatryan","last_name":"Asatryan","@id":"/users/044be67a-626c-42dc-8727-4d068d42e967/","@type":["user","item"],"email":"babken.asatryan@students.unibe.ch"},"uuid":"03e973d8-a298-436b-ac5f-fb4d83b01de8","date_created":"2018-06-05T11:51:06.429243+00:00","affiliation":"10003","@id":"/evidencescore/03e973d8-a298-436b-ac5f-fb4d83b01de8/","scoreStatus":"Score","caseControl_scored":[],"status":"in progress","calculatedScore":0.5,"@type":["evidenceScore","item"],"individual_scored":[],"modified_by":{"uuid":"044be67a-626c-42dc-8727-4d068d42e967","first_name":"Babken","lab":"/labs/curator/","date_created":"2018-03-20T07:00:00+00:00","user_status":"active","affiliation":["10003","10035"],"title":"Babken Asatryan","last_name":"Asatryan","@id":"/users/044be67a-626c-42dc-8727-4d068d42e967/","@type":["user","item"],"email":"babken.asatryan@students.unibe.ch"},"schema_version":"2","experimental_scored":["/experimental/c92cb4a0-76e9-4969-be69-af9cb3ee882e/"],"evidenceType":"Experimental","last_modified":"2018-06-05T11:51:06.426451+00:00"}],"@type":["experimental","item"],"evidenceType":"Expression","last_modified":"2018-06-05T11:51:06.693492+00:00","biochemicalFunction":{"geneWithSameFunctionSameDisease":{},"geneFunctionConsistentWithPhenotype":{"phenotypeHPO":[]}},"date_created":"2018-06-05T11:51:06.693502+00:00","@id":"/experimental/c92cb4a0-76e9-4969-be69-af9cb3ee882e/","status":"in progress","modelSystems":{},"associatedAnnotations":[{"submitted_by":"/users/044be67a-626c-42dc-8727-4d068d42e967/","uuid":"56b7231f-beb9-4e79-8498-434b0faf4855","date_created":"2018-06-05T11:49:44.356856+00:00","number_family":"","affiliation":"10003","individuals":[],"@id":"/evidence/56b7231f-beb9-4e79-8498-434b0faf4855/","groups":[],"status":"in progress","modified_by":"/users/044be67a-626c-42dc-8727-4d068d42e967/","families":[],"@type":["annotation","item"],"number_group":"","schema_version":"4","number_experimental":1,"active":true,"article":{"submitted_by":"/users/044be67a-626c-42dc-8727-4d068d42e967/","uuid":"33377bad-8daf-49b0-a72d-5e14429f61f5","active":true,"date_created":"2018-06-05T11:49:44.059906+00:00","journal":"Clinical genetics","title":"Protein expression studies of desmoplakin mutations in cardiomyopathy patients reveal different molecular disease mechanisms.","@id":"/articles/23137101/","abstract":"Mutations in the gene for desmoplakin (DSP) may cause arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) and Carvajal syndrome (CS). Desmoplakin is part of all desmosomes, which are abundantly expressed in both myocardial and epidermal tissue and serve as intercellular mechanical junctions. This study aimed to investigate protein expression in myocardial and epidermal tissue of ARVC and CS patients carrying DSP mutations in order to elucidate potential molecular disease mechanisms. Genetic investigations identified three ARVC patients carrying different heterozygous DSP mutations in addition to a homozygous DSP mutation in a CS patient. The protein expression of DSP in mutation carriers was evaluated in biopsies from myocardial and epidermal tissue by immunohistochemistry. Keratinocyte cultures were established from skin biopsies of mutation carriers and characterized by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, western blotting, and protein mass spectrometry. The results showed that the mutation carriers had abnormal DSP expression in both myocardial and epidermal tissue. The investigations revealed that the disease mechanisms varied accordingly to the specific types of DSP mutation identified and included haploinsufficiency, dominant-negative effects, or a combination hereof. Furthermore, the results suggest that the keratinocytes cultured from patients are a valuable and easily accessible resource to elucidate the effects of desmosomal gene mutations in humans.","authors":["Rasmussen TB","Hansen J","Nissen PH","Palmfeldt J","Dalager S","Jensen UB","Kim WY","Heickendorff L","M\u00f8lgaard H","Jensen HK","S\u00f8rensen KE","Baandrup UT","Bross P","Mogensen J"],"pmid":"23137101","@type":["article","item"],"doi":"","schema_version":"1","date":"2013 Jul;84(1):20-30.","last_modified":"2018-06-05T11:49:44.059890+00:00","modified_by":"/users/044be67a-626c-42dc-8727-4d068d42e967/","pmcid":""},"associatedGdm":[{"submitted_by":"/users/c99732e2-67d8-4e50-859d-e8ff21f0d08b/","uuid":"0683943f-da80-4a3c-8f9f-454d59040eb2","affiliation":"10003","number_pathogenicity":"3","provisionalClassifications":["/provisional/b23da580-269c-4e5d-8f13-91dbe7ea6a57/"],"variantPathogenicity":["/pathogenicity/a754270c-f371-462f-a8cc-9891c51ec171/","/pathogenicity/221ec44f-9148-4eab-92f5-708fe06dfac8/","/pathogenicity/7cbc30d1-1bb8-41bf-b84a-23ff06a5c898/"],"gdm_title":"DSP-70aa27aa-13c7-4f29-9b76-e992f67983b9-0","schema_version":"8","gene":{"uuid":"59123c96-97f0-4ca9-8024-b7b33843f048","entrezId":"1832","previousSymbols":[],"hgncStatus":"Approved","name":"desmoplakin","symbol":"DSP","@id":"/genes/DSP/","previousNames":["desmoplakin (DPI, DPII)"],"chromosome":"6p24.3","status":"current","@type":["gene","item"],"locusType":"gene with protein product","schema_version":"1","omimIds":["125647"],"synonyms":["KPPS2","PPKS2","DPI","DPII"],"hgncId":"HGNC:3052","nameSynonyms":[],"pmids":["1889810"]},"gdm_status":"Summary/Provisional Classifications","annotations":["/evidence/67d74522-f93d-4407-8d82-e3ad3f2b5c38/","/evidence/a5e496b4-86b8-4d91-840f-c645080b9970/","/evidence/a5cefb81-fd47-4591-a329-b562e60a4c14/","/evidence/91889764-c9cc-4bd5-9bbc-40a13ab40a79/","/evidence/56b7231f-beb9-4e79-8498-434b0faf4855/"],"last_modified":"2018-07-13T03:19:44.169592+00:00","draftClassification":"","modeInheritance":"Autosomal dominant inheritance (HP:0000006)","date_created":"2018-05-14T07:57:45.077911+00:00","disease":{"submitted_by":"/users/f41a40ab-cb17-4bcf-b4ae-8901490dbb06/","description":"Arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy with woolly hair and keratoderma is often associated with the gene DSP, encoding desmoplakin.

This was followed by the description of a heterozygous mutation in DSP in an Italian family with ARVC and clear co-segregation of the variant with the disease, PMID 12373648. These findings have been replicated worldwide in several studies performed in different ethnicities, PMID 15941723, PMID 25765472, PMID 23954618, PMID 20864495, PMID 21397041, PMID 24938629. The initial descriptions recognized also a high frequency of left ventricular compromise in families with DSP mutations, PMID 16061754, PMID 28527814.  A murine model was generated able to replicate the arrhythmia phenotype and Cx43 mislocalization, PMID 22240500. A transgenic mouse overexpressing a mutant DSP had increased cardiomyocyte apoptosis, cardiac fibrosis and lipid accumulation PMID 16917092. Abnormal DSP protein expression in DSP mutation carriers has also been reported, PMID 23137101. The role of this gene in this particular disease has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time (in general, at least 3 years). No convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the role of the gene in the specified disease. In summary, based on this overwhelming evidence, DSP is definitely associated with arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy with woolly hair and keratoderma, maximum association score was achieved rapidly after the analysis of few main reports.","affiliation":"10003","classificationStatus":"Approved","approvalReviewDate":"2019-07-12T16:00:00.000Z","provisionalDate":"2020-02-03T21:20:19.318Z","classificationPoints":{"segregation":{"evidenceCountExome":0,"evidenceCountTotal":1,"totalPointsGiven":3.91,"evidencePointsExome":0,"evidencePointsCandidate":3.91,"pointsCounted":1,"evidenceCountCandidate":1},"geneticEvidenceTotal":12,"autosomalRecessiveDisorder":{"twoVariantsInTransWithOneDeNovo":{"evidenceCount":0,"totalPointsGiven":0},"pointsCounted":0,"twoVariantsWithGeneImpactInTrans":{"evidenceCount":0,"totalPointsGiven":0}},"function":{"proteinInteractions":{"evidenceCount":0,"totalPointsGiven":0},"expression":{"evidenceCount":1,"totalPointsGiven":0.5},"totalPointsGiven":0.5,"pointsCounted":0.5,"biochemicalFunctions":{"evidenceCount":0,"totalPointsGiven":0}},"modelsRescue":{"modelsNonHuman":{"evidenceCount":1,"totalPointsGiven":2},"pointsCounted":2,"rescuePatientCells":{"evidenceCount":0,"totalPointsGiven":0},"modelsCellCulture":{"evidenceCount":0,"totalPointsGiven":0},"rescueHuman":{"evidenceCount":0,"totalPointsGiven":0},"rescueCellCulture":{"evidenceCount":0,"totalPointsGiven":0},"totalPointsGiven":2,"rescueNonHuman":{"evidenceCount":0,"totalPointsGiven":0}},"experimentalEvidenceTotal":2.5,"evidencePointsTotal":14.5,"autosomalDominantOrXlinkedDisorder":{"probandWithPredictedOrProvenNullVariant":{"evidenceCount":8,"pointsCounted":10,"totalPointsGiven":12},"variantIsDeNovo":{"evidenceCount":0,"pointsCounted":0,"totalPointsGiven":0},"probandWithOtherVariantTypeWithGeneImpact":{"evidenceCount":2,"pointsCounted":1,"totalPointsGiven":1}},"functionalAlteration":{"pointsCounted":0,"patientCells":{"evidenceCount":0,"totalPointsGiven":0},"totalPointsGiven":0,"nonPatientCells":{"evidenceCount":0,"totalPointsGiven":0}},"caseControl":{"evidenceCount":0,"pointsCounted":0,"totalPointsGiven":0}},"schema_version":"11","publishClassification":true,"approvalSubmitter":"Courtney Thaxton","provisionedClassification":true,"publishAffiliation":"40003","publishSubmitter":"Courtney Thaxton","last_modified":"2020-05-08T13:50:37.748+00:00","additionalApprover":"","publishDate":"2020-05-08T13:50:37.748Z","sopVersion":"7","alteredClassification":"No Modification","date_created":"2018-06-14T10:22:43.782474+00:00","classificationContributors":[],"classificationDate":"2020-02-03T21:19:44.483Z","@id":"/provisional/b23da580-269c-4e5d-8f13-91dbe7ea6a57/","approvalDate":"2020-05-08T13:49:08.757Z","autoClassification":"Definitive","modified_by":"/users/de63cd49-ce44-4514-8222-91145761f157/","approvedClassification":true,"@type":["provisionalClassification","item"],"gdm_associated":["/gdm/0683943f-da80-4a3c-8f9f-454d59040eb2/"],"classificationApprover":"Cindy James","contradictingEvidence":{"caseControl":false,"proband":false,"experimental":false},"active":true,"provisionalReviewDate":"2019-07-12T16:00:00.000Z","provisionalSubmitter":"Courtney Thaxton","reasons":""},"resourceId":"b23da580-269c-4e5d-8f13-91dbe7ea6a57","last_modified":"2020-05-08T13:50:37.354314+00:00"}
