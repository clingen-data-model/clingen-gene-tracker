600996) is an autosomal dominant cardiomyopathy, characterized by partial degeneration of the myocardium of the right ventricle, electrical instability and sudden death. The disease locus was mapped to chromosome 1q42--q43. We report here on the physical mapping of the critical ARVD2 region, exclusion of two candidate genes (actinin 2 and nidogen), elucidation of the genomic structure of the cardiac ryanodine receptor gene (RYR2) and identification of RYR2 mutations in four independent families. In myocardial cells, the RyR2 protein, activated by Ca(2+), induces the release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum into the cytosol. RyR2 is the cardiac counterpart of RyR1, the skeletal muscle ryanodine receptor, involved in malignant hyperthermia (MH) susceptibility and in central core disease (CCD). The RyR2 mutations detected in the present study occurred in two highly conserved regions, strictly corresponding to those where mutations causing MH or CCD are clustered in the RYR1 gene. The detection of RyR2 mutations causing ARVD2, reported in this paper, opens the way to pre-symptomatic detection of carriers of the disease in childhood, thus enabling early monitoring and treatment.","uuid":"ff28df40-e300-4dd2-8d0d-94d7a7e335d9","authors":["Tiso N","Stephan DA","Nava A","Bagattin A","Devaney JM","Stanchi F","Larderet G","Brahmbhatt B","Brown K","Bauce B","Muriago

600996) is an autosomal dominant cardiomyopathy, characterized by partial degeneration of the myocardium of the right ventricle, electrical instability and sudden death. The disease locus was mapped to chromosome 1q42--q43. We report here on the physical mapping of the critical ARVD2 region, exclusion of two candidate genes (actinin 2 and nidogen), elucidation of the genomic structure of the cardiac ryanodine receptor gene (RYR2) and identification of RYR2 mutations in four independent families. In myocardial cells, the RyR2 protein, activated by Ca(2+), induces the release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum into the cytosol. RyR2 is the cardiac counterpart of RyR1, the skeletal muscle ryanodine receptor, involved in malignant hyperthermia (MH) susceptibility and in central core disease (CCD). The RyR2 mutations detected in the present study occurred in two highly conserved regions, strictly corresponding to those where mutations causing MH or CCD are clustered in the RYR1 gene. The detection of RyR2 mutations causing ARVD2, reported in this paper, opens the way to pre-symptomatic detection of carriers of the disease in childhood, thus enabling early monitoring and treatment.","uuid":"ff28df40-e300-4dd2-8d0d-94d7a7e335d9","authors":["Tiso N","Stephan DA","Nava A","Bagattin A","Devaney JM","Stanchi F","Larderet G","Brahmbhatt B","Brown K","Bauce B","Muriago

There are three human RyR subtypes, and several debilitating diseases are linked to heritable mutations in RyR1 and RyR2 including malignant hypothermia, central core disease, catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) and arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia type 2 (ARVD2). Despite the recent appreciation that many disease-associated mutations within the N-terminal RyRABC domains (i.e., residues 1-559) are located in the putative interfaces mediating tetrameric channel assembly, the precise structural and dynamical consequences of the mutations are not well understood. We used solution nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and X-ray crystallography to examine the effect of ARVD2-associated (i.e., R176Q) and CPVT-associated [i.e., P164S, R169Q and delta exon 3 (\u03943)] mutations on the structure and dynamics of RyR2A. Our solution NMR data exposed a mobile \u03b1-helix, unique to type 2; further, this \u03b12 helix rescues the \u03b2-strand lost in RyR2A \u03943 but remains dynamic in the hot-spot loop (HS-loop) P164S, R169Q and R176Q mutant proteins. Docking of our X-ray crystal/NMR hybrid structure into the RyR1 cryo-electron microscopy map revealed that this RyR2A \u03b12 helix is in close proximity to dense \"columns\" projecting toward the channel pore. This is in contrast to the HS-loop mutations that cause structural changes largely localized to the intersubunit interface between adjacent ABC domains. Taken together, our data suggest that ARVD2 and CPVT mutations have at least two distinct structural consequences linked to channel dysfunction: perturbation of the HS-loop (i.e., domain A):domain B intersubunit interface and disruption of the communication between the N-terminal region and the channel domain.","uuid":"b7dd8d9d-eafc-41c4-839e-c363ee849004","authors":["Amador FJ","Kimlicka L","Stathopulos PB","Gasmi-Seabrook GM","Maclennan DH","Van Petegem F","Ikura M"],"journal":"Journal of molecular biology","schema_version":"1","title":"Type 2 ryanodine receptor domain A contains a unique and dynamic \u03b1-helix that transitions to a \u03b2-strand in a mutant linked with a heritable cardiomyopathy."}],"race":"","date_created":"2018-06-07T09:51:04.464218+00:00","countryOfOrigin":"Italy","termsInDiagnosis":"CPVT with fibro-fatty replacement of the right ventricle (PMID: 11078270)","affiliation":"10003","termsInElimination":"","status":"in progress","commonDiagnosis":[{"phenotypes":[],"submitted_by":"/users/2a1dcf80-beb1-4b1e-9478-cf7f4904911b/","status":"in progress","modified_by":"/users/ac57e92b-f144-4b03-9d34-5c24b317e155/","last_modified":"2017-06-16T01:03:16.788277+00:00","synonyms":["ARVC","ARVD","Right Ventricular Dysplasia","Arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia","arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia/cardiomyopathy","Arrhythmogenic RVD","arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia","ARVC cardiomyopathy"],"date_created":"2017-06-16T01:03:16.788266+00:00","term":"arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy","diseaseId":"MONDO_0016587","@type":["disease","item"],"description":"Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) is a heart muscle disease that consists in progressive dystrophy of primarily the right ventricular myocardium with fibro-fatty replacement and ventricular dilation, and that is clinically characterized by ventricular arrhythmias and a risk of sudden cardiac death.","@id":"/diseases/cd1c30fe-1089-4821-9fb1-1b630e828d99/","associatedFamilies":["/families/fd361567-cf74-4715-a9f6-44782ebe2ca7/","/families/af04519f-af9e-49ec-a290-0af3cd85e87c/","/families/856943c4-df14-4c03-bb01-efff20a4559d/","/families/c5f613ec-1a2b-4a11-8bba-ad608fa3027a/","/families/222382ad-9289-4b66-b8c1-a945d8b6d644/","/families/9964a5d6-b5b1-40e4-b8aa-6fae77ef2ac8/","/families/55a55714-bab1-469d-852d-0fb37cede197/","/families/572f864f-062c-4567-a5f4-29da77b0f327/","/families/5bf5449f-9b4a-47f3-9266-e6fb089550d0/"],"uuid":"cd1c30fe-1089-4821-9fb1-1b630e828d99","associatedIndividuals":["/individuals/f09809bc-ba8e-4f8b-9fa5-d5ea751d3b4f/","/individuals/7f2c49a6-20d5-4aaa-b0e1-788041a7d5b1/","/individuals/dabaa6a8-4ba0-4345-a0c6-05306e82194d/","/individuals/6e6cd24d-425f-4aca-ba05-9f2efe3b7412/","/individuals/cceaae21-d378-497b-aa63-d20568a41b91/","/individuals/64e8b512-bc41-4e0e-9b1b-02addde63dab/","/individuals/3c546e38-4ab6-4ee7-872a-fdcbae98a21e/","/individuals/a863d20b-4549-4751-87ef-fab1c6cce244/","/individuals/19a11c03-66cb-4687-9ce0-a883946c61c5/","/individuals/758d698e-3b9f-42af-8383-55eab77f3e27/"],"associatedGdm":["/gdm/da443dd4-1d44-4b7c-b3cb-6481af9cbcae/","/gdm/bab4804f-b258-4f21-85ea-1d0a355e9725/","/gdm/8200c2b7-d0fe-4ed5-bb2a-ab5f28566a27/","/gdm/36a5a7df-f731-40bd-852f-19d24979a93e/","/gdm/56045ff4-256d-437a-884f-34e077a57a85/","/gdm/0a25f66d-9a61-4ee1-8a46-85e25fd22ef0/","/gdm/93800ee5-05fb-4196-9bcf-99939fc9a44d/","/gdm/b3f44f54-e74a-4892-b4bd-8866b8fb89ed/","/gdm/a50f2232-856e-4fa4-b023-22ab5649e974/","/gdm/b34ded29-f1d5-4cca-a84a-0140b2460ef7/"],"associatedInterpretations":["/interpretations/06a33c34-2d3d-4862-99c5-f81933dda3cf/","/interpretations/31b4ed40-d533-4f17-b0f5-2fb5470452f6/"],"schema_version":"2","associatedGroups":["/groups/2af2f04f-1eb3-4284-bcdf-ebeb7594ab9e/","/groups/a1b2121b-8c0c-46d3-8d07-5b54c51f0d1c/","/groups/a2de4577-fc8d-4185-b335-8bf5eda0782f/","/groups/59cae23d-6bb1-488c-b27a-cd53e4c2969c/","/groups/c3fc341e-fd3d-448d-bda2-daa4d52de451/","/groups/02a2f38f-7cbe-45b7-a6e5-2946fe7f7eeb/","/groups/b86f667b-652e-47e5-aa95-41d7a64ff38b/","/groups/56d5e76e-c7b9-4629-8c52-a3bac3e4a35d/","/groups/89a57350-8669-4193-a3da-eeee03b5c72d/","/groups/0c64ab08-22b8-451a-bfea-44ae37088fec/"]}],"modified_by":{"last_name":"Lekanne dit Deprez","user_status":"active","email":"r.h.lekanne@amc.uva.nl","uuid":"9542c088-e65e-4890-bb8e-a6647811b34e","lab":"/labs/curator/","affiliation":["10003","10035"],"date_created":"2018-03-20T07:00:00+00:00","@type":["user","item"],"@id":"/users/9542c088-e65e-4890-bb8e-a6647811b34e/","first_name":"Ronald","title":"Ronald Lekanne dit Deprez"},"additionalInformation":"also variant NM_001035.2(RYR2):c.7511C>T;

The disease locus was mapped to chromosome 1q42--q43. We report here on the physical mapping of the critical ARVD2 region, exclusion of two candidate genes (actinin 2 and nidogen), elucidation of the genomic structure of the cardiac ryanodine receptor gene (RYR2) and identification of RYR2 mutations in four independent families. In myocardial cells, the RyR2 protein, activated by Ca(2+), induces the release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum into the cytosol. RyR2 is the cardiac counterpart of RyR1, the skeletal muscle ryanodine receptor, involved in malignant hyperthermia (MH) susceptibility and in central core disease (CCD). The RyR2 mutations detected in the present study occurred in two highly conserved regions, strictly corresponding to those where mutations causing MH or CCD are clustered in the RYR1 gene. The detection of RyR2 mutations causing ARVD2, reported in this paper, opens the way to pre-symptomatic detection of carriers of the disease in childhood, thus enabling early monitoring and treatment.","uuid":"ff28df40-e300-4dd2-8d0d-94d7a7e335d9","authors":["Tiso N","Stephan DA","Nava A","Bagattin A","Devaney JM","Stanchi F","Larderet G","Brahmbhatt B","Brown K","Bauce B","Muriago

600996) is an autosomal dominant cardiomyopathy, characterized by partial degeneration of the myocardium of the right ventricle, electrical instability and sudden death. The disease locus was mapped to chromosome 1q42--q43. We report here on the physical mapping of the critical ARVD2 region, exclusion of two candidate genes (actinin 2 and nidogen), elucidation of the genomic structure of the cardiac ryanodine receptor gene (RYR2) and identification of RYR2 mutations in four independent families. In myocardial cells, the RyR2 protein, activated by Ca(2+), induces the release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum into the cytosol. RyR2 is the cardiac counterpart of RyR1, the skeletal muscle ryanodine receptor, involved in malignant hyperthermia (MH) susceptibility and in central core disease (CCD). The RyR2 mutations detected in the present study occurred in two highly conserved regions, strictly corresponding to those where mutations causing MH or CCD are clustered in the RYR1 gene. The detection of RyR2 mutations causing ARVD2, reported in this paper, opens the way to pre-symptomatic detection of carriers of the disease in childhood, thus enabling early monitoring and treatment.","uuid":"ff28df40-e300-4dd2-8d0d-94d7a7e335d9","authors":["Tiso N","Stephan DA","Nava A","Bagattin A","Devaney JM","Stanchi F","Larderet G","Brahmbhatt B","Brown K","Bauce B","Muriago

600996) is an autosomal dominant cardiomyopathy, characterized by partial degeneration of the myocardium of the right ventricle, electrical instability and sudden death. The disease locus was mapped to chromosome 1q42--q43. We report here on the physical mapping of the critical ARVD2 region, exclusion of two candidate genes (actinin 2 and nidogen), elucidation of the genomic structure of the cardiac ryanodine receptor gene (RYR2) and identification of RYR2 mutations in four independent families. In myocardial cells, the RyR2 protein, activated by Ca(2+), induces the release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum into the cytosol. RyR2 is the cardiac counterpart of RyR1, the skeletal muscle ryanodine receptor, involved in malignant hyperthermia (MH) susceptibility and in central core disease (CCD). The RyR2 mutations detected in the present study occurred in two highly conserved regions, strictly corresponding to those where mutations causing MH or CCD are clustered in the RYR1 gene. The detection of RyR2 mutations causing ARVD2, reported in this paper, opens the way to pre-symptomatic detection of carriers of the disease in childhood, thus enabling early monitoring and treatment.","uuid":"ff28df40-e300-4dd2-8d0d-94d7a7e335d9","authors":["Tiso N","Stephan DA","Nava A","Bagattin A","Devaney JM","Stanchi F","Larderet G","Brahmbhatt B","Brown K","Bauce B","Muriago

600996) is an autosomal dominant cardiomyopathy, characterized by partial degeneration of the myocardium of the right ventricle, electrical instability and sudden death. The disease locus was mapped to chromosome 1q42--q43. We report here on the physical mapping of the critical ARVD2 region, exclusion of two candidate genes (actinin 2 and nidogen), elucidation of the genomic structure of the cardiac ryanodine receptor gene (RYR2) and identification of RYR2 mutations in four independent families. In myocardial cells, the RyR2 protein, activated by Ca(2+), induces the release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum into the cytosol. RyR2 is the cardiac counterpart of RyR1, the skeletal muscle ryanodine receptor, involved in malignant hyperthermia (MH) susceptibility and in central core disease (CCD). The RyR2 mutations detected in the present study occurred in two highly conserved regions, strictly corresponding to those where mutations causing MH or CCD are clustered in the RYR1 gene. The detection of RyR2 mutations causing ARVD2, reported in this paper, opens the way to pre-symptomatic detection of carriers of the disease in childhood, thus enabling early monitoring and treatment.","uuid":"ff28df40-e300-4dd2-8d0d-94d7a7e335d9","authors":["Tiso N","Stephan DA","Nava A","Bagattin A","Devaney JM","Stanchi F","Larderet G","Brahmbhatt B","Brown K","Bauce B","Muriago

600996) is an autosomal dominant cardiomyopathy, characterized by partial degeneration of the myocardium of the right ventricle, electrical instability and sudden death. The disease locus was mapped to chromosome 1q42--q43. We report here on the physical mapping of the critical ARVD2 region, exclusion of two candidate genes (actinin 2 and nidogen), elucidation of the genomic structure of the cardiac ryanodine receptor gene (RYR2) and identification of RYR2 mutations in four independent families. In myocardial cells, the RyR2 protein, activated by Ca(2+), induces the release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum into the cytosol. RyR2 is the cardiac counterpart of RyR1, the skeletal muscle ryanodine receptor, involved in malignant hyperthermia (MH) susceptibility and in central core disease (CCD). The RyR2 mutations detected in the present study occurred in two highly conserved regions, strictly corresponding to those where mutations causing MH or CCD are clustered in the RYR1 gene. The detection of RyR2 mutations causing ARVD2, reported in this paper, opens the way to pre-symptomatic detection of carriers of the disease in childhood, thus enabling early monitoring and treatment.","uuid":"ff28df40-e300-4dd2-8d0d-94d7a7e335d9","authors":["Tiso N","Stephan DA","Nava A","Bagattin A","Devaney JM","Stanchi F","Larderet G","Brahmbhatt B","Brown K","Bauce B","Muriago

600996) is an autosomal dominant cardiomyopathy, characterized by partial degeneration of the myocardium of the right ventricle, electrical instability and sudden death. The disease locus was mapped to chromosome 1q42--q43. We report here on the physical mapping of the critical ARVD2 region, exclusion of two candidate genes (actinin 2 and nidogen), elucidation of the genomic structure of the cardiac ryanodine receptor gene (RYR2) and identification of RYR2 mutations in four independent families. In myocardial cells, the RyR2 protein, activated by Ca(2+), induces the release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum into the cytosol. RyR2 is the cardiac counterpart of RyR1, the skeletal muscle ryanodine receptor, involved in malignant hyperthermia (MH) susceptibility and in central core disease (CCD). The RyR2 mutations detected in the present study occurred in two highly conserved regions, strictly corresponding to those where mutations causing MH or CCD are clustered in the RYR1 gene. The detection of RyR2 mutations causing ARVD2, reported in this paper, opens the way to pre-symptomatic detection of carriers of the disease in childhood, thus enabling early monitoring and treatment.","uuid":"ff28df40-e300-4dd2-8d0d-94d7a7e335d9","authors":["Tiso N","Stephan DA","Nava A","Bagattin A","Devaney JM","Stanchi F","Larderet G","Brahmbhatt B","Brown K","Bauce B","Muriago

The disease locus was mapped to chromosome 1q42--q43. We report here on the physical mapping of the critical ARVD2 region, exclusion of two candidate genes (actinin 2 and nidogen), elucidation of the genomic structure of the cardiac ryanodine receptor gene (RYR2) and identification of RYR2 mutations in four independent families. In myocardial cells, the RyR2 protein, activated by Ca(2+), induces the release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum into the cytosol. RyR2 is the cardiac counterpart of RyR1, the skeletal muscle ryanodine receptor, involved in malignant hyperthermia (MH) susceptibility and in central core disease (CCD). The RyR2 mutations detected in the present study occurred in two highly conserved regions, strictly corresponding to those where mutations causing MH or CCD are clustered in the RYR1 gene. The detection of RyR2 mutations causing ARVD2, reported in this paper, opens the way to pre-symptomatic detection of carriers of the disease in childhood, thus enabling early monitoring and treatment.","uuid":"ff28df40-e300-4dd2-8d0d-94d7a7e335d9","authors":["Tiso N","Stephan DA","Nava A","Bagattin A","Devaney JM","Stanchi F","Larderet G","Brahmbhatt B","Brown K","Bauce B","Muriago M","Basso C","Thiene G","Danieli GA","Rampazzo A"],"journal":"Human molecular genetics","schema_version":"1","title":"Identification of mutations in the cardiac ryanodine receptor gene in families affected with arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy type 2 (ARVD2)."},"schema_version":"4","associatedGdm":["/gdm/71b34544-97df-43de-863a-c965cce44356/"]},{"number_group":"","submitted_by":{"last_name":"Lekanne dit Deprez","user_status":"active","email":"r.h.lekanne@amc.uva.nl","uuid":"9542c088-e65e-4890-bb8e-a6647811b34e","lab":"/labs/curator/","affiliation":["10003","10035"],"date_created":"2018-03-20T07:00:00+00:00","@type":["user","item"],"@id":"/users/9542c088-e65e-4890-bb8e-a6647811b34e/","first_name":"Ronald","title":"Ronald Lekanne dit Deprez"},"active":true,"last_modified":"2018-06-07T10:42:38.214436+00:00","modified_by":"/users/9542c088-e65e-4890-bb8e-a6647811b34e/","families":[],"date_created":"2018-06-07T10:21:56.712507+00:00","@type":["annotation","item"],"number_family":"","experimentalData":[{"submitted_by":{"last_name":"Lekanne dit Deprez","user_status":"active","email":"r.h.lekanne@amc.uva.nl","uuid":"9542c088-e65e-4890-bb8e-a6647811b34e","lab":"/labs/curator/","affiliation":["10003","10035"],"date_created":"2018-03-20T07:00:00+00:00","@type":["user","item"],"@id":"/users/9542c088-e65e-4890-bb8e-a6647811b34e/","first_name":"Ronald","title":"Ronald Lekanne dit Deprez"},"active":true,"last_modified":"2018-06-07T10:42:36.831089+00:00","date_created":"2018-06-07T10:42:36.830746+00:00","proteinInteractions":{},"assessments":[],"functionalAlteration":{},"expression":{"normalExpression":{},"alteredExpression":{},"organOfTissue":[]},"modelSystems":{"nonHumanModel":"Mouse (Mus musculus) 10090","phenotypeFreetextObserved":"more CPVT phenotype (no evidence of fibrofatty infiltration or\nstructural abnormalities characteristic;

To study the relationship between RyR2 function and these phenotypes, we developed knockin mice with the human disease-associated RyR2 mutation R176Q. Histologic analysis of hearts from RyR2(R176Q/+) mice revealed no evidence of fibrofatty infiltration or structural abnormalities characteristic of arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia, but right ventricular end-diastolic volume was decreased in RyR2(R176Q/+) mice compared with controls, indicating subtle functional impairment due to the presence of a single mutant allele. Ventricular tachycardia (VT) was observed after caffeine and epinephrine injection in RyR2(R176Q/+), but not in WT, mice. Intracardiac electrophysiology studies with programmed stimulation also elicited VT in RyR2(R176Q/+) mice. Isoproterenol administration during programmed stimulation increased both the number and duration of VT episodes in RyR2(R176Q/+) mice, but not in controls. Isolated cardiomyocytes from RyR2(R176Q/+) mice exhibited a higher incidence of spontaneous Ca(2+) oscillations in the absence and presence of isoproterenol compared with controls. Our results suggest that the R176Q mutation in RyR2 predisposes the heart to catecholamine-induced oscillatory calcium-release events that trigger a calcium-dependent ventricular arrhythmia.","uuid":"5bd91668-0581-4479-92af-1ea98b92cc07","authors":["Kannankeril PJ","Mitchell BM","Goonasekera SA","Chelu MG","Zhang W","Sood S","Kearney DL","Danila CI","De Biasi M","Wehrens

associated with catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia and a form of arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia. To study the relationship between RyR2 function and these phenotypes, we developed knockin mice with the human disease-associated RyR2 mutation R176Q. Histologic analysis of hearts from RyR2(R176Q/+) mice revealed no evidence of fibrofatty infiltration or structural abnormalities characteristic of arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia, but right ventricular end-diastolic volume was decreased in RyR2(R176Q/+) mice compared with controls, indicating subtle functional impairment due to the presence of a single mutant allele. Ventricular tachycardia (VT) was observed after caffeine and epinephrine injection in RyR2(R176Q/+), but not in WT, mice. Intracardiac electrophysiology studies with programmed stimulation also elicited VT in RyR2(R176Q/+) mice. Isoproterenol administration during programmed stimulation increased both the number and duration of VT episodes in RyR2(R176Q/+) mice, but not in controls. Isolated cardiomyocytes from RyR2(R176Q/+) mice exhibited a higher incidence of spontaneous Ca(2+) oscillations in the absence and presence of isoproterenol compared with controls. Our results suggest that the R176Q mutation in RyR2 predisposes the heart to catecholamine-induced oscillatory calcium-release events that trigger a calcium-dependent ventricular arrhythmia.","uuid":"5bd91668-0581-4479-92af-1ea98b92cc07","authors":["Kannankeril PJ","Mitchell BM","Goonasekera SA","Chelu MG","Zhang W","Sood S","Kearney DL","Danila CI","De Biasi M","Wehrens

a heritable cardiomyopathy characterized by fibro-fatty replacement of right ventricular myocardium. Diagnostic criteria, established in 1994 and modified in 2010, are based on predominately adult manifestations of ARVC/D. The goal of this paper is to review a single-center experience with pediatric ARVC/D and propose modifications of current diagnostic criteria to appropriately include pediatric ARVC/D. We identified 16 pediatric cases of ARVC/D from our tertiary care center. Patient demographics, presentation, course, genetic testing, and family history were reviewed. Sixteen patients were diagnosed with ARVC/D through the modified diagnostic criteria, genetic testing, and pathology. Five patients had positive family histories. Five patients presented with cardiac arrest, and six were found to have ventricular tachycardia. Two patients presented with heart failure. Six autopsies, six explanted hearts, and three biopsies found massive fibro-fatty infiltration of the right ventricular wall. Six patients underwent heart transplantation, and two have received automatic implantable cardioverter defibrillator. Two patients had identifiable genetic mutations previously noted in the literature. One patient had a novel mutation of a known ARVC/D gene. Many pediatric patients do not meet the current ARVC/D diagnostic criteria, resulting in delays in diagnosis and treatment. The current criteria need further revision to encompass pediatric manifestations of ARVC/D. In our opinion, pathological and clinical findings alone are sufficient for accurate diagnosis of pediatric ARVC/D. Creating modified pediatric criteria would facilitate prompt diagnosis and management of ARVC/D and facilitate structured research with the goal of improving outcomes.

Diagnostic criteria, established in 1994 and modified in 2010, are based on predominately adult manifestations of ARVC/D. The goal of this paper is to review a single-center experience with pediatric ARVC/D and propose modifications of current diagnostic criteria to appropriately include pediatric ARVC/D. We identified 16 pediatric cases of ARVC/D from our tertiary care center. Patient demographics, presentation, course, genetic testing, and family history were reviewed. Sixteen patients were diagnosed with ARVC/D through the modified diagnostic criteria, genetic testing, and pathology. Five patients had positive family histories. Five patients presented with cardiac arrest, and six were found to have ventricular tachycardia. Two patients presented with heart failure. Six autopsies, six explanted hearts, and three biopsies found massive fibro-fatty infiltration of the right ventricular wall. Six patients underwent heart transplantation, and two have received automatic implantable cardioverter defibrillator. Two patients had identifiable genetic mutations previously noted in the literature. One patient had a novel mutation of a known ARVC/D gene. Many pediatric patients do not meet the current ARVC/D diagnostic criteria, resulting in delays in diagnosis and treatment. The current criteria need further revision to encompass pediatric manifestations of ARVC/D. In our opinion, pathological and clinical findings alone are sufficient for accurate diagnosis of pediatric ARVC/D. Creating modified pediatric criteria would facilitate prompt diagnosis and management of ARVC/D and facilitate structured research with the goal of improving outcomes.

of the myocardium, including hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), and arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC), with higher morbidity and mortality. These diseases are genetically diverse and associated with rare mutations in a large number of genes, many of which overlap among the phenotypes. To better investigate the genetic overlap between these three phenotypes and to identify new genotype-phenotype correlations, we designed a custom gene panel consisting of 115 genes known to be associated with cardiomyopathic phenotypes and channelopathies. A cohort of 38 unrelated patients, 16 affected by DCM, 14 by HCM and 8 by ARVC, was recruited for the study on the basis of more severe phenotypes and family history of cardiomyopathy and/or sudden death. We detected a total of 142 rare variants in 40 genes, and all patients were found to be carriers of at least one rare variant. Twenty-eight of the 142 rare variants were also predicted as potentially pathogenic variants and found in 26 patients. In 23 out of 38 patients, we found at least one novel potential gene-phenotype association. In particular, we detected three variants in OBSCN gene in ARVC patients, four variants in ANK2 gene and two variants in DLG1, TRPM4, and AKAP9 genes in DCM patients, two variants in PSEN2 gene and four variants in AKAP9 gene in HCM patients. Overall, our results confirmed that cardiomyopathic patients could carry multiple rare gene variants; in addition, our investigation of the genetic overlap among cardiomyopathies revealed new gene-phenotype associations. Furthermore, as our study confirms, data obtained using targeted next-generation sequencing could provide a remarkable contribution to the molecular diagnosis of cardiomyopathies, early identification of patients at risk for arrhythmia development, and better clinical management of cardiomyopathic patients.","uuid":"31c285e9-1a73-45f9-b0bd-edfcbaab691c","authors":["Forleo C","D'Erchia

the myocardium, including hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), and arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC), with higher morbidity and mortality. These diseases are genetically diverse and associated with rare mutations in a large number of genes, many of which overlap among the phenotypes. To better investigate the genetic overlap between these three phenotypes and to identify new genotype-phenotype correlations, we designed a custom gene panel consisting of 115 genes known to be associated with cardiomyopathic phenotypes and channelopathies. A cohort of 38 unrelated patients, 16 affected by DCM, 14 by HCM and 8 by ARVC, was recruited for the study on the basis of more severe phenotypes and family history of cardiomyopathy and/or sudden death. We detected a total of 142 rare variants in 40 genes, and all patients were found to be carriers of at least one rare variant. Twenty-eight of the 142 rare variants were also predicted as potentially pathogenic variants and found in 26 patients. In 23 out of 38 patients, we found at least one novel potential gene-phenotype association. In particular, we detected three variants in OBSCN gene in ARVC patients, four variants in ANK2 gene and two variants in DLG1, TRPM4, and AKAP9 genes in DCM patients, two variants in PSEN2 gene and four variants in AKAP9 gene in HCM patients. Overall, our results confirmed that cardiomyopathic patients could carry multiple rare gene variants; in addition, our investigation of the genetic overlap among cardiomyopathies revealed new gene-phenotype associations. Furthermore, as our study confirms, data obtained using targeted next-generation sequencing could provide a remarkable contribution to the molecular diagnosis of cardiomyopathies, early identification of patients at risk for arrhythmia development, and better clinical management of cardiomyopathic patients.","uuid":"31c285e9-1a73-45f9-b0bd-edfcbaab691c","authors":["Forleo C","D'Erchia AM","Sorrentino S","Manzari C","Chiara M","Iacoviello M","Guaricci AI","De Santis D","Musci RL","La Spada A","Marangelli V","Pesole G","Favale S"],"journal":"PloS one","schema_version":"1","title":"Targeted next-generation sequencing detects novel gene-phenotype associations and expands the mutational spectrum in cardiomyopathies."},"schema_version":"4","associatedGdm":["/gdm/71b34544-97df-43de-863a-c965cce44356/"]},{"number_group":"","submitted_by":{"last_name":"Lekanne dit Deprez","user_status":"active","email":"r.h.lekanne@amc.uva.nl","uuid":"9542c088-e65e-4890-bb8e-a6647811b34e","lab":"/labs/curator/","affiliation":["10003","10035"],"date_created":"2018-03-20T07:00:00+00:00","@type":["user","item"],"@id":"/users/9542c088-e65e-4890-bb8e-a6647811b34e/","first_name":"Ronald","title":"Ronald Lekanne dit Deprez"},"active":true,"last_modified":"2018-06-19T07:58:05.827203+00:00","modified_by":"/users/9542c088-e65e-4890-bb8e-a6647811b34e/","families":[],"date_created":"2018-06-19T07:20:26.662585+00:00","@type":["annotation","item"],"number_family":"","experimentalData":[],"affiliation":"10003","@id":"/evidence/56478144-800f-4789-88f5-821512f26033/","number_individual":1,"uuid":"56478144-800f-4789-88f5-821512f26033","number_experimental":"","groups":[],"status":"in progress","individuals":[{"submitted_by":{"last_name":"Lekanne dit Deprez","user_status":"active","email":"r.h.lekanne@amc.uva.nl","uuid":"9542c088-e65e-4890-bb8e-a6647811b34e","lab":"/labs/curator/","affiliation":["10003","10035"],"date_created":"2018-03-20T07:00:00+00:00","@type":["user","item"],"@id":"/users/9542c088-e65e-4890-bb8e-a6647811b34e/","first_name":"Ronald","title":"Ronald Lekanne dit Deprez"},"active":true,"last_modified":"2018-06-19T07:58:02.845887+00:00","otherPMIDs":[],"is_proband":"Yes","hpoIdInDiagnosis":[],"date_created":"2018-06-19T07:58:02.846253+00:00","countryOfOrigin":"India","associatedFamilies":[],"termsInDiagnosis":"Clinically the patient harboring RyR-2 gene mutation suffered from symptoms of dyspnea and presyncope during physical strain, an episode of syncope and swelling of limbs for the past 6\u20137 years and was diagnosed with ARVC at the age of 55 years.

A molecular genetics investigation carried out in the paraffin-embedded myocardium of the subject and in blood samples of family members disclosed a missense mutation in exon 3 (230C-->T; A77V) of the cardiac ryanodine receptor type 2 gene. The carriers showed effort-induced polymorphic ventricular tachycardia in the setting of normal resting electrocardiogram and trivial echocardiographic abnormalities, consistent with catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia. The observation of both arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy type 2 and catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia in the same family suggests that the two entities might correspond to different degrees of phenotypic expression of the same disease. This experience underscores the importance of a precise autopsy diagnosis in the case of sudden cardiac death, including molecular genetics, and the mission of pathologists to guide further clinical investigation of family members.","uuid":"b516b48c-9584-4009-85d3-fbed428adf96","authors":["d'Amati G","Bagattin A","Bauce B","Rampazzo A","Autore C","Basso C","King K","Romeo MD","Gallo P","Thiene

The index case was a 17-year-old boy who died suddenly and at postmortem had evidence of fibrofatty replacement in the right ventricular free wall, consistent with arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy, as well as calcium phosphate deposits within the myocytes. A molecular genetics investigation carried out in the paraffin-embedded myocardium of the subject and in blood samples of family members disclosed a missense mutation in exon 3 (230C-->T; A77V) of the cardiac ryanodine receptor type 2 gene. The carriers showed effort-induced polymorphic ventricular tachycardia in the setting of normal resting electrocardiogram and trivial echocardiographic abnormalities, consistent with catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia. The observation of both arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy type 2 and catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia in the same family suggests that the two entities might correspond to different degrees of phenotypic expression of the same disease. This experience underscores the importance of a precise autopsy diagnosis in the case of sudden cardiac death, including molecular genetics, and the mission of pathologists to guide further clinical investigation of family members.","uuid":"b516b48c-9584-4009-85d3-fbed428adf96","authors":["d'Amati G","Bagattin A","Bauce B","Rampazzo A","Autore C","Basso C","King K","Romeo MD","Gallo P","Thiene

effort-induced polymorphic ventricular arrhythmias. The index case was a 17-year-old boy who died suddenly and at postmortem had evidence of fibrofatty replacement in the right ventricular free wall, consistent with arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy, as well as calcium phosphate deposits within the myocytes. A molecular genetics investigation carried out in the paraffin-embedded myocardium of the subject and in blood samples of family members disclosed a missense mutation in exon 3 (230C-->T; A77V) of the cardiac ryanodine receptor type 2 gene. The carriers showed effort-induced polymorphic ventricular tachycardia in the setting of normal resting electrocardiogram and trivial echocardiographic abnormalities, consistent with catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia. The observation of both arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy type 2 and catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia in the same family suggests that the two entities might correspond to different degrees of phenotypic expression of the same disease. This experience underscores the importance of a precise autopsy diagnosis in the case of sudden cardiac death, including molecular genetics, and the mission of pathologists to guide further clinical investigation of family members.","uuid":"b516b48c-9584-4009-85d3-fbed428adf96","authors":["d'Amati G","Bagattin A","Bauce B","Rampazzo A","Autore C","Basso C","King K","Romeo MD","Gallo P","Thiene G","Danieli GA","Nava A"],"journal":"Human pathology","schema_version":"1","title":"Juvenile sudden death in a family with polymorphic ventricular arrhythmias caused by a novel RyR2 gene mutation: evidence of specific morphological substrates."},"schema_version":"4","associatedGdm":["/gdm/71b34544-97df-43de-863a-c965cce44356/"]},{"number_group":"","submitted_by":{"last_name":"Lekanne dit Deprez","user_status":"active","email":"r.h.lekanne@amc.uva.nl","uuid":"9542c088-e65e-4890-bb8e-a6647811b34e","lab":"/labs/curator/","affiliation":["10003","10035"],"date_created":"2018-03-20T07:00:00+00:00","@type":["user","item"],"@id":"/users/9542c088-e65e-4890-bb8e-a6647811b34e/","first_name":"Ronald","title":"Ronald Lekanne dit Deprez"},"active":true,"last_modified":"2018-06-21T06:32:19.588197+00:00","modified_by":"/users/9542c088-e65e-4890-bb8e-a6647811b34e/","families":[],"date_created":"2018-06-21T06:03:19.781139+00:00","@type":["annotation","item"],"number_family":"","experimentalData":[],"affiliation":"10003","@id":"/evidence/52560338-4921-49a1-a466-b6f72b3b0927/","number_individual":2,"uuid":"52560338-4921-49a1-a466-b6f72b3b0927","number_experimental":"","groups":[],"status":"in progress","individuals":[{"submitted_by":{"last_name":"Lekanne dit Deprez","user_status":"active","email":"r.h.lekanne@amc.uva.nl","uuid":"9542c088-e65e-4890-bb8e-a6647811b34e","lab":"/labs/curator/","affiliation":["10003","10035"],"date_created":"2018-03-20T07:00:00+00:00","@type":["user","item"],"@id":"/users/9542c088-e65e-4890-bb8e-a6647811b34e/","first_name":"Ronald","title":"Ronald Lekanne dit Deprez"},"active":true,"last_modified":"2018-06-21T06:22:25.459022+00:00","otherPMIDs":[],"is_proband":"Yes","hpoIdInDiagnosis":[],"date_created":"2018-06-21T06:22:25.464362+00:00","countryOfOrigin":"Japan","associatedFamilies":[],"termsInDiagnosis":"fatty replacement of the right ventricle","ageUnit":"","assessment_count":0,"proband":true,"method":{"genomeWideStudy":false,"dateTime":"2018-06-21T08:22:25+02:00","additionalInformation":"","genotypingMethods":[],"specificMutationsGenotypedMethod":"NGS of 70 cardiacdisorder-related genes associated with cardiomyopathies and channelopa-\nthies","previousTestingDescription":""},"status":"in progress","scores":[{"scoreStatus":"Score","submitted_by":{"last_name":"Lekanne dit Deprez","user_status":"active","email":"r.h.lekanne@amc.uva.nl","uuid":"9542c088-e65e-4890-bb8e-a6647811b34e","lab":"/labs/curator/","affiliation":["10003","10035"],"date_created":"2018-03-20T07:00:00+00:00","@type":["user","item"],"@id":"/users/9542c088-e65e-4890-bb8e-a6647811b34e/","first_name":"Ronald","title":"Ronald Lekanne dit Deprez"},"status":"in progress","last_modified":"2018-06-22T12:32:55.616994+00:00","score":0.25,"caseControl_scored":[],"caseInfoType":"OTHER_VARIANT_TYPE_WITH_GENE_IMPACT","@type":["evidenceScore","item"],"experimental_scored":[],"date_created":"2018-06-22T12:32:55.619426+00:00","modified_by":{"last_name":"Lekanne dit Deprez","user_status":"active","email":"r.h.lekanne@amc.uva.nl","uuid":"9542c088-e65e-4890-bb8e-a6647811b34e","lab":"/labs/curator/","affiliation":["10003","10035"],"date_created":"2018-03-20T07:00:00+00:00","@type":["user","item"],"@id":"/users/9542c088-e65e-4890-bb8e-a6647811b34e/","first_name":"Ronald","title":"Ronald Lekanne dit Deprez"},"affiliation":"10003","@id":"/evidencescore/9666e824-cfe5-4939-9b97-ad0e4f22167d/","calculatedScore":0.5,"uuid":"9666e824-cfe5-4939-9b97-ad0e4f22167d","evidenceScored":"825acf06-9762-40bc-9b78-11b9f5322e0d","individual_scored":["/individuals/825acf06-9762-40bc-9b78-11b9f5322e0d/"],"evidenceType":"Individual","schema_version":"2","scoreExplanation":"It is not clear if the patient also suffers from CPVT"}],"affiliation":"10003","additionalInformation":"3 additional variant found:\n\nAlso NM_000257.3(MYH7):c.77C>T;

management in cardiac myocytes are a major cause of heart failure and sudden cardiac death worldwide. The human ryanodine receptor 2 (RYR2) is one of the key players tightly regulating calcium efflux from the sarcoplasmic reticulum to the cytosol and found frequently mutated (<60%) in context of catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT1). We tested 35 Kazakhstani patients with episodes of ventricular arrhythmia, two of those with classical CPVT characteristics and 33 patients with monomorphic idiopathic ventricular arrhythmia, for variants in the hot-spot regions of the RYR2 gene. This approach revealed two novel variants; one de-novo RYR2 mutation (c13892A>T; p.D4631V) in a CPVT patient and a novel rare variant (c5428G>C; p.V1810L) of uncertain significance in a patient with VT of idiopathic origin which we suggest represents a low-penetrance or susceptibility variant. In addition we identified a known variant previously associated with arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia type2 (ARVD2). Combining sets of prediction scores and reference databases appeared fundamental to predict the pathogenic potential of novel and rare missense variants in populations where genotype data are rare.

There are three human RyR subtypes, and several debilitating diseases are linked to heritable mutations in RyR1 and RyR2 including malignant hypothermia, central core disease, catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) and arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia type 2 (ARVD2). Despite the recent appreciation that many disease-associated mutations within the N-terminal RyRABC domains (i.e., residues 1-559) are located in the putative interfaces mediating tetrameric channel assembly, the precise structural and dynamical consequences of the mutations are not well understood. We used solution nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and X-ray crystallography to examine the effect of ARVD2-associated (i.e., R176Q) and CPVT-associated [i.e., P164S, R169Q and delta exon 3 (\u03943)] mutations on the structure and dynamics of RyR2A. Our solution NMR data exposed a mobile \u03b1-helix, unique to type 2; further, this \u03b12 helix rescues the \u03b2-strand lost in RyR2A \u03943 but remains dynamic in the hot-spot loop (HS-loop) P164S, R169Q and R176Q mutant proteins. Docking of our X-ray crystal/NMR hybrid structure into the RyR1 cryo-electron microscopy map revealed that this RyR2A \u03b12 helix is in close proximity to dense \"columns\" projecting toward the channel pore. This is in contrast to the HS-loop mutations that cause structural changes largely localized to the intersubunit interface between adjacent ABC domains. Taken together, our data suggest that ARVD2 and CPVT mutations have at least two distinct structural consequences linked to channel dysfunction: perturbation of the HS-loop (i.e., domain A):domain B intersubunit interface and disruption of the communication between the N-terminal region and the channel domain.","uuid":"b7dd8d9d-eafc-41c4-839e-c363ee849004","authors":["Amador FJ","Kimlicka L","Stathopulos PB","Gasmi-Seabrook GM","Maclennan DH","Van Petegem F","Ikura M"],"journal":"Journal of molecular biology","schema_version":"1","title":"Type 2 ryanodine receptor domain A contains a unique and dynamic \u03b1-helix that transitions to a \u03b2-strand in a mutant linked with a heritable cardiomyopathy."},"schema_version":"4","associatedGdm":["/gdm/71b34544-97df-43de-863a-c965cce44356/"]},{"number_group":"","submitted_by":{"last_name":"Lekanne dit Deprez","user_status":"active","email":"r.h.lekanne@amc.uva.nl","uuid":"9542c088-e65e-4890-bb8e-a6647811b34e","lab":"/labs/curator/","affiliation":["10003","10035"],"date_created":"2018-03-20T07:00:00+00:00","@type":["user","item"],"@id":"/users/9542c088-e65e-4890-bb8e-a6647811b34e/","first_name":"Ronald","title":"Ronald Lekanne dit Deprez"},"active":true,"last_modified":"2018-06-21T12:17:23.493276+00:00","modified_by":"/users/9542c088-e65e-4890-bb8e-a6647811b34e/","families":[],"date_created":"2018-06-21T11:57:47.858773+00:00","@type":["annotation","item"],"number_family":"","experimentalData":[{"submitted_by":{"last_name":"Lekanne dit Deprez","user_status":"active","email":"r.h.lekanne@amc.uva.nl","uuid":"9542c088-e65e-4890-bb8e-a6647811b34e","lab":"/labs/curator/","affiliation":["10003","10035"],"date_created":"2018-03-20T07:00:00+00:00","@type":["user","item"],"@id":"/users/9542c088-e65e-4890-bb8e-a6647811b34e/","first_name":"Ronald","title":"Ronald Lekanne dit Deprez"},"active":true,"last_modified":"2018-06-21T12:17:21.299940+00:00","date_created":"2018-06-21T12:17:21.304002+00:00","proteinInteractions":{"geneImplicatedInDisease":false,"relationshipOfOtherGenesToDisese":"FKBP12.6 is the gating protein of RYR2","interactionType":"physical association (MI:0915)","interactingGenes":[{"hgncStatus":"Approved","status":"current","nameSynonyms":["calstabin 2"],"synonyms":["OTK4","FKBP12.6","PPIase","FKBP9"],"@type":["gene","item"],"@id":"/genes/FKBP1B/","entrezId":"2281","omimIds":["600620"],"symbol":"FKBP1B","chromosome":"2p23.3","uuid":"e619eb22-6f5c-48f1-8cae-02f2dc55cf2a","previousSymbols":["FKBP1L"],"hgncId":"HGNC:3712","pmids":["7513996"],"name":"FK506 binding protein 1B, 12.6 kDa","locusType":"gene with protein product","schema_version":"1","previousNames":["FK506-binding protein 1B (12.6 kD)"]}],"experimentalInteractionDetection":"two hybrid (MI:0018)","evidenceInPaper":"By using a quantitative yeast two-hybrid system, we show that VTSIP- and ARVD2-associated point mutations influence positively and negatively, respectively, the binding of RyR2 to its gating protein FKBP12.6 (=FKBP1B .

We also provide evidence of the suitability of this system to test new drugs that target RyRs-FKBP12s interactions and do not affect yeast growth.","uuid":"1a0c02e4-5dec-4af9-b310-85891d4f8cb4","authors":["Tiso N","Salamon M","Bagattin A","Danieli GA","Argenton F","Bortolussi M"],"journal":"Biochemical and biophysical research communications","schema_version":"1","title":"The binding of the RyR2 calcium channel to its gating protein FKBP12.6 is oppositely affected by ARVD2 and VTSIP mutations."},"schema_version":"4","associatedGdm":["/gdm/71b34544-97df-43de-863a-c965cce44356/"]}],"@type":["gdm","item"],"modified_by":"/users/8cd2b1fa-0cfb-4ca6-85ba-fdf985faeeed/","variantPathogenicity":[],"@id":"/gdm/71b34544-97df-43de-863a-c965cce44356/","uuid":"71b34544-97df-43de-863a-c965cce44356","finalClassification":"","schema_version":"8"}},"date_created":"2020-05-13T00:27:33.953355+00:00","@type":["snapshot","item"],"resourceType":"classification","modified_by":"/users/de63cd49-ce44-4514-8222-91145761f157/","@id":"/snapshots/d5c46fcd-75b1-4af2-9c41-f505d3ebe75a/","uuid":"d5c46fcd-75b1-4af2-9c41-f505d3ebe75a","resource":{"classificationDate":"2020-05-13T00:26:21.574Z","provisionalDate":"2020-05-13T00:26:43.362Z","active":true,"submitted_by":"/users/de63cd49-ce44-4514-8222-91145761f157/","last_modified":"2020-05-13T00:30:25.043+00:00","publishDate":"2020-05-13T00:30:25.043Z","date_created":"2019-07-16T17:50:27.330259+00:00","classificationPoints":{"function":{"totalPointsGiven":0,"pointsCounted":0,"expression":{"evidenceCount":0,"totalPointsGiven":0},"proteinInteractions":{"evidenceCount":1,"totalPointsGiven":0},"biochemicalFunctions":{"evidenceCount":0,"totalPointsGiven":0}},"modelsRescue":{"totalPointsGiven":0,"rescueCellCulture":{"evidenceCount":0,"totalPointsGiven":0},"modelsNonHuman":{"evidenceCount":0,"totalPointsGiven":0},"rescueNonHuman":{"evidenceCount":0,"totalPointsGiven":0},"modelsCellCulture":{"evidenceCount":0,"totalPointsGiven":0},"pointsCounted":0,"rescuePatientCells":{"evidenceCount":0,"totalPointsGiven":0},"rescueHuman":{"evidenceCount":0,"totalPointsGiven":0}},"evidencePointsTotal":1.25,"caseControl":{"evidenceCount":1,"totalPointsGiven":0,"pointsCounted":0},"experimentalEvidenceTotal":0,"segregation":{"totalPointsGiven":0,"evidencePointsExome":0,"evidencePointsCandidate":0,"evidenceCountTotal":0,"pointsCounted":0,"evidenceCountCandidate":0,"evidenceCountExome":0},"geneticEvidenceTotal":1.25,"functionalAlteration":{"totalPointsGiven":0,"pointsCounted":0,"patientCells":{"evidenceCount":0,"totalPointsGiven":0},"nonPatientCells":{"evidenceCount":0,"totalPointsGiven":0}},"autosomalRecessiveDisorder":{"twoVariantsInTransWithOneDeNovo":{"evidenceCount":0,"totalPointsGiven":0},"pointsCounted":0,"twoVariantsWithGeneImpactInTrans":{"evidenceCount":0,"totalPointsGiven":0}},"autosomalDominantOrXlinkedDisorder":{"probandWithOtherVariantTypeWithGeneImpact":{"evidenceCount":8,"totalPointsGiven":1.25,"pointsCounted":1.25},"variantIsDeNovo":{"evidenceCount":0,"totalPointsGiven":0,"pointsCounted":0},"probandWithPredictedOrProvenNullVariant":{"evidenceCount":0,"totalPointsGiven":0,"pointsCounted":0}}},"publishSubmitter":"Courtney Thaxton","provisionalSubmitter":"Courtney Thaxton","additionalApprover":"","publishClassification":true,"approvalDate":"2020-05-13T00:27:28.395Z","replicatedOverTime":false,"autoClassification":"Limited","classificationStatus":"Approved","gdm_associated":["/gdm/71b34544-97df-43de-863a-c965cce44356/"],"sopVersion":"7","approvalReviewDate":"2019-07-19T16:00:00.000Z","modified_by":"/users/de63cd49-ce44-4514-8222-91145761f157/","affiliation":"10003","classificationApprover":"Cindy James","publishAffiliation":"40003","evidenceSummary":"Fifty-seven papers were reviewed related to RYR2 and ARVD (9628868, 11078270, 11159936, 11807805, 12015469, 12106942, 12169647, 12459180, 12596074, 12919952, 15046075, 15176428, 15336972, 15451514, 15544015, 15831148, 15951021, 16084945, 16096717, 16239587, 16407108, 16733711, 16769042, 16873551, 16873551, 17363426, 17980246, 18326664, 18483626, 18515204, 19029124, 19167631, 19863545, 20045464, 20301310, 21977247, 22068070, 22090716, 22374134, 22450909, 22453944, 23978697, 24447446, 24978818, 25041964, 25411383, 25445213, 26082335, 26743400, 27000522, 27005929, 27548259, 27635072, 28750076, 29497013, 29543670, Rampazzo A et al., Hum Mol Genet 1995). Three publications from the same research group found linkage to chromosome 1q42-q43 and variants in RYR2 in families with right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC2) also described as CPVT with fibro-fatty replacement of the right ventricle   (Rampazzo A et al., Hum Mol Genet 1995; 4(11):2151\u20132154; 11078270; 11159936). A mouse model made from one of the variants (RyR2 R176Q/_ ) found in family 105 that has two variants on one allele (R176Q/T2504M),  showed a CPVT like phenotype without evidence of fibrofatty infiltration or structural abnormalities characteristic of arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia (16873551). In several papers RYR2 missense variants were described in possible ARVD index patients. Some of these variants were also relatively often present in reference alleles from the gnomAD  database, clear ARVD diagnosis is not provided, segregation information is not informative and/or CPVT was also present in the family  (28750076, 26743400, 25041964, 16084945, 27005929). In a recent review it was also recognized that the observed phenotype in the original three publications that reported RYR2 variants in ARVD for the first time should be catecholamine-induced ventricular tachycardia rather than ARVD, and this gene is no longer considered as ARVD causing (29543670). This gene is therefore refuted as a candidate for ARVD.","reasons":"This classification was refuted because the observed phenotype in the original publications that reported RYR2 variants in ARVD  should be catecholamine-induced ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) rather than ARVD. Subsequent variants found in this gene in ARVD patients were uninformative or too frequent to be disease-causing.","@type":["provisionalClassification","item"],"contradictingEvidence":{"caseControl":false,"proband":false,"experimental":true},"classificationContributors":[],"@id":"/provisional/52fa7dee-4daa-4685-9461-f39c57a22f05/","uuid":"52fa7dee-4daa-4685-9461-f39c57a22f05","approvalSubmitter":"Courtney Thaxton","alteredClassification":"Refuted","provisionedClassification":true,"provisionalReviewDate":"2019-07-16T16:00:00.000Z","schema_version":"11","approvedClassification":true},"associatedSnapshot":"/snapshots/ddbf6d57-904c-4b3c-a349-52c61f4713d5/","approvalStatus":"Approved","schema_version":"2"}
