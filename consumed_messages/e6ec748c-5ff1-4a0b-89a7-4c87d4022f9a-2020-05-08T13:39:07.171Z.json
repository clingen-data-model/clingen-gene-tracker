cardiomyopathy/dysplasia (ARVC/D) causes sudden cardiac death and is characterized by clinical and genetic heterogeneity. Fifteen unrelated ARVC families with a disease-associated haplotype on chromosome 3p (ARVD5) were ascertained from a genetically isolated population. Identification of key recombination events reduced the disease region to a 2.36 Mb interval containing 20 annotated genes. Bidirectional resequencing showed one rare variant in transmembrane protein 43 (TMEM43 1073C-->T, S358L), was carried on all recombinant ARVD5 ancestral haplotypes from affected subjects and not found in population controls. The mutation occurs in a highly conserved transmembrane domain of TMEM43 and is predicted to be deleterious. Clinical outcomes in 257 affected and 151 unaffected subjects were compared, and penetrance was determined. We concluded that ARVC at locus ARVD5 is a lethal, fully penetrant, sex-influenced morbid disorder. Median life expectancy was 41 years in affected males compared to 71 years in affected females (relative risk 6.8, 95% CI 1.3-10.9). Heart failure was a late manifestation in survivors. Although little is known about the function of the TMEM43 gene, it contains a response element for PPAR gamma (an adipogenic transcription factor), which may explain the fibrofatty replacement of the myocardium, a characteristic pathological finding in ARVC.","date_created":"2017-02-10T17:57:15.057443+00:00","pmid":"18313022"},"active":true,"experimentalData":["/experimental/003bf646-0a23-421d-88dc-5cbda61bbf30/"],"number_family":"","date_created":"2018-04-09T19:00:49.738684+00:00","modified_by":"/users/84a6e93b-5075-4dfb-9de5-a9fcde89abc9/"}],"@id":"/groups/6927eaf7-a831-4f21-9083-eb244f5d4513/","label":"15 ARVC Families- Newfoundland","uuid":"6927eaf7-a831-4f21-9083-eb244f5d4513","commonDiagnosis":[{"schema_version":"2","submitted_by":"/users/84a6e93b-5075-4dfb-9de5-a9fcde89abc9/","@type":["disease","item"],"associatedGroups":["/groups/30747803-4879-434f-9387-f4b8ee66590f/","/groups/11aa09c6-1ff9-416e-a779-351832140933/","/groups/9bf0a088-eea2-453f-bc92-b490740a0af5/","/groups/4385467c-978f-4595-9ef2-2b8b351002bc/","/groups/6927eaf7-a831-4f21-9083-eb244f5d4513/"],"description":"An arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia  that has material basis in heterozygous mutation in the TMEM43 gene on chromosome 3p25.","associatedIndividuals":["/individuals/af943a2c-1a07-47e4-b3d6-b5e5ffe59b24/","/individuals/9e95c302-b3ce-41b8-96d5-016acfc589bd/","/individuals/5c70e3a3-6e3e-49b6-b74b-9b6ec38e7afe/","/individuals/0f35c5f3-5a23-4847-ac8f-56d1ff4b468d/","/individuals/e0bbf081-f4da-4df7-84cf-1e7651339656/","/individuals/d9d500d1-3e2d-4e43-b69b-026776ece361/","/individuals/4bad2626-5733-44b8-8953-bf1071f466b9/","/individuals/c4233f7f-5eab-4a85-a61a-02b08256af55/","/individuals/5b2e00d7-8aad-4501-838b-5c8c97e628bf/","/individuals/1839f240-e2b1-48d0-b8f7-ec84e964b996/"],"status":"in progress","@id":"/diseases/bf9ea446-2c56-4817-a2e6-8eca5d15c843/","associatedInterpretations":[],"uuid":"bf9ea446-2c56-4817-a2e6-8eca5d15c843","associatedFamilies":["/families/bf9fb6d5-96fe-48a9-a603-d8ced9537e56/","/families/d8ff5e13-6551-41ab-abde-497b90a82349/","/families/424af4e7-596d-4225-8965-a81d87190408/","/families/7e939872-0709-42d4-8527-377bf6952354/"],"diseaseId":"MONDO_0011459","synonyms":["familial arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia 5","arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy 5","Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Dysplasia, Familial, type 5","arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia type 5","ARVD5","ARVC5"],"last_modified":"2018-04-09T18:33:55.828355+00:00","phenotypes":[],"associatedGdm":["/gdm/61ad3529-b9e2-4b94-a388-3c11b1cb5144/"],"term":"arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia 5","date_created":"2018-04-09T18:33:55.828337+00:00","modified_by":"/users/84a6e93b-5075-4dfb-9de5-a9fcde89abc9/"}],"last_modified":"2018-04-09T19:55:33.077557+00:00","additionalInformation":"","method":{"additionalInformation":"","genotypingMethods":[],"dateTime":"2018-04-09T15:14:56-04:00","previousTestingDescription":"","specificMutationsGenotypedMethod":"Comparison of the ARVD5 ancestral haplotypes across clinically affected subjects reduced the region to an interval containing 20 annotated genes.

cardiomyopathy/dysplasia (ARVC/D) causes sudden cardiac death and is characterized by clinical and genetic heterogeneity. Fifteen unrelated ARVC families with a disease-associated haplotype on chromosome 3p (ARVD5) were ascertained from a genetically isolated population. Identification of key recombination events reduced the disease region to a 2.36 Mb interval containing 20 annotated genes. Bidirectional resequencing showed one rare variant in transmembrane protein 43 (TMEM43 1073C-->T, S358L), was carried on all recombinant ARVD5 ancestral haplotypes from affected subjects and not found in population controls. The mutation occurs in a highly conserved transmembrane domain of TMEM43 and is predicted to be deleterious. Clinical outcomes in 257 affected and 151 unaffected subjects were compared, and penetrance was determined. We concluded that ARVC at locus ARVD5 is a lethal, fully penetrant, sex-influenced morbid disorder. Median life expectancy was 41 years in affected males compared to 71 years in affected females (relative risk 6.8, 95% CI 1.3-10.9). Heart failure was a late manifestation in survivors. Although little is known about the function of the TMEM43 gene, it contains a response element for PPAR gamma (an adipogenic transcription factor), which may explain the fibrofatty replacement of the myocardium, a characteristic pathological finding in ARVC.","date_created":"2017-02-10T17:57:15.057443+00:00","pmid":"18313022"},"active":true,"experimentalData":["/experimental/003bf646-0a23-421d-88dc-5cbda61bbf30/"],"number_family":"","date_created":"2018-04-09T19:00:49.738684+00:00","modified_by":"/users/84a6e93b-5075-4dfb-9de5-a9fcde89abc9/"}],"@id":"/groups/6927eaf7-a831-4f21-9083-eb244f5d4513/","label":"15 ARVC Families- Newfoundland","uuid":"6927eaf7-a831-4f21-9083-eb244f5d4513","commonDiagnosis":["/diseases/bf9ea446-2c56-4817-a2e6-8eca5d15c843/"],"last_modified":"2018-04-09T19:55:33.077557+00:00","additionalInformation":"","method":{"additionalInformation":"","genotypingMethods":[],"dateTime":"2018-04-09T15:14:56-04:00","previousTestingDescription":"","specificMutationsGenotypedMethod":"Comparison of the ARVD5 ancestral haplotypes across clinically affected subjects reduced the region to an interval containing 20 annotated genes.

cardiomyopathy/dysplasia (ARVC/D) causes sudden cardiac death and is characterized by clinical and genetic heterogeneity. Fifteen unrelated ARVC families with a disease-associated haplotype on chromosome 3p (ARVD5) were ascertained from a genetically isolated population. Identification of key recombination events reduced the disease region to a 2.36 Mb interval containing 20 annotated genes. Bidirectional resequencing showed one rare variant in transmembrane protein 43 (TMEM43 1073C-->T, S358L), was carried on all recombinant ARVD5 ancestral haplotypes from affected subjects and not found in population controls. The mutation occurs in a highly conserved transmembrane domain of TMEM43 and is predicted to be deleterious. Clinical outcomes in 257 affected and 151 unaffected subjects were compared, and penetrance was determined. We concluded that ARVC at locus ARVD5 is a lethal, fully penetrant, sex-influenced morbid disorder. Median life expectancy was 41 years in affected males compared to 71 years in affected females (relative risk 6.8, 95% CI 1.3-10.9). Heart failure was a late manifestation in survivors. Although little is known about the function of the TMEM43 gene, it contains a response element for PPAR gamma (an adipogenic transcription factor), which may explain the fibrofatty replacement of the myocardium, a characteristic pathological finding in ARVC.","date_created":"2017-02-10T17:57:15.057443+00:00","pmid":"18313022"},"active":true,"experimentalData":["/experimental/003bf646-0a23-421d-88dc-5cbda61bbf30/"],"number_family":"","date_created":"2018-04-09T19:00:49.738684+00:00","modified_by":"/users/84a6e93b-5075-4dfb-9de5-a9fcde89abc9/"}],"@id":"/groups/6927eaf7-a831-4f21-9083-eb244f5d4513/","label":"15 ARVC Families- Newfoundland","uuid":"6927eaf7-a831-4f21-9083-eb244f5d4513","commonDiagnosis":["/diseases/bf9ea446-2c56-4817-a2e6-8eca5d15c843/"],"last_modified":"2018-04-09T19:55:33.077557+00:00","additionalInformation":"","method":{"additionalInformation":"","genotypingMethods":[],"dateTime":"2018-04-09T15:14:56-04:00","previousTestingDescription":"","specificMutationsGenotypedMethod":"Comparison of the ARVD5 ancestral haplotypes across clinically affected subjects reduced the region to an interval containing 20 annotated genes.

cardiomyopathy/dysplasia (ARVC/D) causes sudden cardiac death and is characterized by clinical and genetic heterogeneity. Fifteen unrelated ARVC families with a disease-associated haplotype on chromosome 3p (ARVD5) were ascertained from a genetically isolated population. Identification of key recombination events reduced the disease region to a 2.36 Mb interval containing 20 annotated genes. Bidirectional resequencing showed one rare variant in transmembrane protein 43 (TMEM43 1073C-->T, S358L), was carried on all recombinant ARVD5 ancestral haplotypes from affected subjects and not found in population controls. The mutation occurs in a highly conserved transmembrane domain of TMEM43 and is predicted to be deleterious. Clinical outcomes in 257 affected and 151 unaffected subjects were compared, and penetrance was determined. We concluded that ARVC at locus ARVD5 is a lethal, fully penetrant, sex-influenced morbid disorder. Median life expectancy was 41 years in affected males compared to 71 years in affected females (relative risk 6.8, 95% CI 1.3-10.9). Heart failure was a late manifestation in survivors. Although little is known about the function of the TMEM43 gene, it contains a response element for PPAR gamma (an adipogenic transcription factor), which may explain the fibrofatty replacement of the myocardium, a characteristic pathological finding in ARVC.","date_created":"2017-02-10T17:57:15.057443+00:00","pmid":"18313022"},"active":true,"experimentalData":["/experimental/003bf646-0a23-421d-88dc-5cbda61bbf30/"],"number_family":"","date_created":"2018-04-09T19:00:49.738684+00:00","modified_by":"/users/84a6e93b-5075-4dfb-9de5-a9fcde89abc9/"}],"expression":{"alteredExpression":{},"normalExpression":{"expressedInTissue":true,"evidence":"cDNA

(LUMA) with a distinctive form of arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC). We aimed at performing mutational analysis of the gene and characterizing the associated immunohistochemical features. Sixty-five unrelated patients (55 fulfilling Task Force criteria and 10 borderline cases) were screened for mutations in TMEM43. Immunohistochemistry with anti-TMEM43, anti-plakoglobin, anti-plakophilin-2, anti-connexin-43, and anti-emerin antibodies was performed on myocardium from TMEM43-positive patients (n = 3) and healthy controls (n = 3). The genetic screening identified heterozygous variants in two families: one reported mutation (c.1073C> T; in two related patients) and one novel variant (c.705+ 7G> A; in one patient) of unknown significance. All three patients fulfilled Task Force criteria and did not carry mutations in any other ARVC-related gene. Immunostaining with TMEM43 antibody showed intense staining of the sarcolemma. The signal level was reduced in all the three TMEM43-positive patients. Immunostaining with plakoglobin-specific antibody also showed reduced signal levels in the three carriers. All patients displayed a similar immunoreactive signal for plakophilin-2, connexin-43, and emerin. In conclusion, two TMEM43 sequence variants were identified in this Danish ARVC cohort. Evaluation of the expression of TMEM43 showed a unique cardiac localization. The immunoreactive signal for the desmosomal protein plakoglobin was reduced in mutation carriers. The TMEM43 gene underlies a distinctive form of ARVC which may share a final common pathway with desmosome-associated ARVC.","date_created":"2018-04-10T14:19:04.138747+00:00","pmid":"21214875","modified_by":"/users/84a6e93b-5075-4dfb-9de5-a9fcde89abc9/"},"active":true,"experimentalData":["/experimental/73641512-37a0-4d90-91ea-6d5971e60deb/"],"number_family":"","date_created":"2018-04-10T14:19:04.297012+00:00","modified_by":"/users/84a6e93b-5075-4dfb-9de5-a9fcde89abc9/"}],"@id":"/groups/30747803-4879-434f-9387-f4b8ee66590f/","label":"Denmark ARVC Cohort","uuid":"30747803-4879-434f-9387-f4b8ee66590f","commonDiagnosis":[{"schema_version":"2","submitted_by":"/users/84a6e93b-5075-4dfb-9de5-a9fcde89abc9/","@type":["disease","item"],"associatedGroups":["/groups/30747803-4879-434f-9387-f4b8ee66590f/","/groups/11aa09c6-1ff9-416e-a779-351832140933/","/groups/9bf0a088-eea2-453f-bc92-b490740a0af5/","/groups/4385467c-978f-4595-9ef2-2b8b351002bc/","/groups/6927eaf7-a831-4f21-9083-eb244f5d4513/"],"description":"An arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia  that has material basis in heterozygous mutation in the TMEM43 gene on chromosome 3p25.","associatedIndividuals":["/individuals/af943a2c-1a07-47e4-b3d6-b5e5ffe59b24/","/individuals/9e95c302-b3ce-41b8-96d5-016acfc589bd/","/individuals/5c70e3a3-6e3e-49b6-b74b-9b6ec38e7afe/","/individuals/0f35c5f3-5a23-4847-ac8f-56d1ff4b468d/","/individuals/e0bbf081-f4da-4df7-84cf-1e7651339656/","/individuals/d9d500d1-3e2d-4e43-b69b-026776ece361/","/individuals/4bad2626-5733-44b8-8953-bf1071f466b9/","/individuals/c4233f7f-5eab-4a85-a61a-02b08256af55/","/individuals/5b2e00d7-8aad-4501-838b-5c8c97e628bf/","/individuals/1839f240-e2b1-48d0-b8f7-ec84e964b996/"],"status":"in progress","@id":"/diseases/bf9ea446-2c56-4817-a2e6-8eca5d15c843/","associatedInterpretations":[],"uuid":"bf9ea446-2c56-4817-a2e6-8eca5d15c843","associatedFamilies":["/families/bf9fb6d5-96fe-48a9-a603-d8ced9537e56/","/families/d8ff5e13-6551-41ab-abde-497b90a82349/","/families/424af4e7-596d-4225-8965-a81d87190408/","/families/7e939872-0709-42d4-8527-377bf6952354/"],"diseaseId":"MONDO_0011459","synonyms":["familial arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia 5","arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy 5","Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Dysplasia, Familial, type 5","arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia type 5","ARVD5","ARVC5"],"last_modified":"2018-04-09T18:33:55.828355+00:00","phenotypes":[],"associatedGdm":["/gdm/61ad3529-b9e2-4b94-a388-3c11b1cb5144/"],"term":"arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia 5","date_created":"2018-04-09T18:33:55.828337+00:00","modified_by":"/users/84a6e93b-5075-4dfb-9de5-a9fcde89abc9/"}],"last_modified":"2018-04-10T15:07:23.828020+00:00","additionalInformation":"","method":{"additionalInformation":"","genotypingMethods":["PCR","Sanger sequencing"],"dateTime":"2018-04-10T10:27:39-04:00","previousTestingDescription":"Initial screening of 5 desomosmal genes (DSC2, DSG2, DSP, JUP and PKP2) identified mutations in 33% of patients.

(LUMA) with a distinctive form of arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC). We aimed at performing mutational analysis of the gene and characterizing the associated immunohistochemical features. Sixty-five unrelated patients (55 fulfilling Task Force criteria and 10 borderline cases) were screened for mutations in TMEM43. Immunohistochemistry with anti-TMEM43, anti-plakoglobin, anti-plakophilin-2, anti-connexin-43, and anti-emerin antibodies was performed on myocardium from TMEM43-positive patients (n = 3) and healthy controls (n = 3). The genetic screening identified heterozygous variants in two families: one reported mutation (c.1073C> T; in two related patients) and one novel variant (c.705+ 7G> A; in one patient) of unknown significance. All three patients fulfilled Task Force criteria and did not carry mutations in any other ARVC-related gene. Immunostaining with TMEM43 antibody showed intense staining of the sarcolemma. The signal level was reduced in all the three TMEM43-positive patients. Immunostaining with plakoglobin-specific antibody also showed reduced signal levels in the three carriers. All patients displayed a similar immunoreactive signal for plakophilin-2, connexin-43, and emerin. In conclusion, two TMEM43 sequence variants were identified in this Danish ARVC cohort. Evaluation of the expression of TMEM43 showed a unique cardiac localization. The immunoreactive signal for the desmosomal protein plakoglobin was reduced in mutation carriers.

(LUMA) with a distinctive form of arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC). We aimed at performing mutational analysis of the gene and characterizing the associated immunohistochemical features. Sixty-five unrelated patients (55 fulfilling Task Force criteria and 10 borderline cases) were screened for mutations in TMEM43. Immunohistochemistry with anti-TMEM43, anti-plakoglobin, anti-plakophilin-2, anti-connexin-43, and anti-emerin antibodies was performed on myocardium from TMEM43-positive patients (n = 3) and healthy controls (n = 3). The genetic screening identified heterozygous variants in two families: one reported mutation (c.1073C> T; in two related patients) and one novel variant (c.705+ 7G> A; in one patient) of unknown significance. All three patients fulfilled Task Force criteria and did not carry mutations in any other ARVC-related gene. Immunostaining with TMEM43 antibody showed intense staining of the sarcolemma. The signal level was reduced in all the three TMEM43-positive patients. Immunostaining with plakoglobin-specific antibody also showed reduced signal levels in the three carriers. All patients displayed a similar immunoreactive signal for plakophilin-2, connexin-43, and emerin. In conclusion, two TMEM43 sequence variants were identified in this Danish ARVC cohort. Evaluation of the expression of TMEM43 showed a unique cardiac localization. The immunoreactive signal for the desmosomal protein plakoglobin was reduced in mutation carriers. The TMEM43 gene underlies a distinctive form of ARVC which may share a final common pathway with desmosome-associated ARVC.","date_created":"2018-04-10T14:19:04.138747+00:00","pmid":"21214875","modified_by":"/users/84a6e93b-5075-4dfb-9de5-a9fcde89abc9/"},"active":true,"experimentalData":["/experimental/73641512-37a0-4d90-91ea-6d5971e60deb/"],"number_family":"","date_created":"2018-04-10T14:19:04.297012+00:00","modified_by":"/users/84a6e93b-5075-4dfb-9de5-a9fcde89abc9/"}],"expression":{"alteredExpression":{"expressedInPatients":true,"evidenceInPaper":"Figure 3","evidence":"Immunohistochemical analysis of the myocardium showed reduced signal in the ARVC patients with TMEM43 variants.

cardiomyopathy (ARVC) is a myocardial disease characterized by fibro-fatty replacement of right ventricular free wall myocardium and life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias. A missense mutation, c.1073C>T (p.S358L) in the transmembrane protein 43 (TMEM43) gene, has been genetically identified to cause ARVC type 5 in a founder population from Newfoundland. It is unclear whether this mutation occurs in other populations outside of this founder population or if other variants of TMEM43 are associated with ARVC disease. We sought to identify non-Newfoundland individuals with TMEM43 variants among patient samples sent for genetic assessment for possible ARVC. Of 195 unrelated individuals with suspected ARVC, mutation of desmosomal proteins was seen in 28 and the p.S358L TMEM43 mutation in six. We identified a de novo p.S358L mutation in a non-Newfoundland patient and five separate rare TMEM43 (four novel) sequence variants in non-Newfoundland patients, each occurring in an evolutionarily conserved amino acid. TMEM43 mutations occur outside of the founder population of the island of Newfoundland where it was originally described. TMEM43 sequencing should be incorporated into clinical genetic testing for ARVC patients.

cardiomyopathy (ARVC) is a myocardial disease characterized by fibro-fatty replacement of right ventricular free wall myocardium and life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias. A missense mutation, c.1073C>T (p.S358L) in the transmembrane protein 43 (TMEM43) gene, has been genetically identified to cause ARVC type 5 in a founder population from Newfoundland. It is unclear whether this mutation occurs in other populations outside of this founder population or if other variants of TMEM43 are associated with ARVC disease. We sought to identify non-Newfoundland individuals with TMEM43 variants among patient samples sent for genetic assessment for possible ARVC. Of 195 unrelated individuals with suspected ARVC, mutation of desmosomal proteins was seen in 28 and the p.S358L TMEM43 mutation in six. We identified a de novo p.S358L mutation in a non-Newfoundland patient and five separate rare TMEM43 (four novel) sequence variants in non-Newfoundland patients, each occurring in an evolutionarily conserved amino acid. TMEM43 mutations occur outside of the founder population of the island of Newfoundland where it was originally described. TMEM43 sequencing should be incorporated into clinical genetic testing for ARVC patients.

cardiomyopathy (ARVC) is a myocardial disease characterized by fibro-fatty replacement of right ventricular free wall myocardium and life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias. A missense mutation, c.1073C>T (p.S358L) in the transmembrane protein 43 (TMEM43) gene, has been genetically identified to cause ARVC type 5 in a founder population from Newfoundland. It is unclear whether this mutation occurs in other populations outside of this founder population or if other variants of TMEM43 are associated with ARVC disease. We sought to identify non-Newfoundland individuals with TMEM43 variants among patient samples sent for genetic assessment for possible ARVC. Of 195 unrelated individuals with suspected ARVC, mutation of desmosomal proteins was seen in 28 and the p.S358L TMEM43 mutation in six. We identified a de novo p.S358L mutation in a non-Newfoundland patient and five separate rare TMEM43 (four novel) sequence variants in non-Newfoundland patients, each occurring in an evolutionarily conserved amino acid. TMEM43 mutations occur outside of the founder population of the island of Newfoundland where it was originally described. TMEM43 sequencing should be incorporated into clinical genetic testing for ARVC patients.

cardiomyopathy (ARVC) is a myocardial disease characterized by fibro-fatty replacement of right ventricular free wall myocardium and life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias. A missense mutation, c.1073C>T (p.S358L) in the transmembrane protein 43 (TMEM43) gene, has been genetically identified to cause ARVC type 5 in a founder population from Newfoundland. It is unclear whether this mutation occurs in other populations outside of this founder population or if other variants of TMEM43 are associated with ARVC disease. We sought to identify non-Newfoundland individuals with TMEM43 variants among patient samples sent for genetic assessment for possible ARVC. Of 195 unrelated individuals with suspected ARVC, mutation of desmosomal proteins was seen in 28 and the p.S358L TMEM43 mutation in six. We identified a de novo p.S358L mutation in a non-Newfoundland patient and five separate rare TMEM43 (four novel) sequence variants in non-Newfoundland patients, each occurring in an evolutionarily conserved amino acid. TMEM43 mutations occur outside of the founder population of the island of Newfoundland where it was originally described. TMEM43 sequencing should be incorporated into clinical genetic testing for ARVC patients.

cardiomyopathy (ARVC) is a myocardial disease characterized by fibro-fatty replacement of right ventricular free wall myocardium and life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias. A missense mutation, c.1073C>T (p.S358L) in the transmembrane protein 43 (TMEM43) gene, has been genetically identified to cause ARVC type 5 in a founder population from Newfoundland. It is unclear whether this mutation occurs in other populations outside of this founder population or if other variants of TMEM43 are associated with ARVC disease. We sought to identify non-Newfoundland individuals with TMEM43 variants among patient samples sent for genetic assessment for possible ARVC. Of 195 unrelated individuals with suspected ARVC, mutation of desmosomal proteins was seen in 28 and the p.S358L TMEM43 mutation in six. We identified a de novo p.S358L mutation in a non-Newfoundland patient and five separate rare TMEM43 (four novel) sequence variants in non-Newfoundland patients, each occurring in an evolutionarily conserved amino acid. TMEM43 mutations occur outside of the founder population of the island of Newfoundland where it was originally described. TMEM43 sequencing should be incorporated into clinical genetic testing for ARVC patients.

cardiomyopathy (ARVC) is a myocardial disease characterized by fibro-fatty replacement of right ventricular free wall myocardium and life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias. A missense mutation, c.1073C>T (p.S358L) in the transmembrane protein 43 (TMEM43) gene, has been genetically identified to cause ARVC type 5 in a founder population from Newfoundland. It is unclear whether this mutation occurs in other populations outside of this founder population or if other variants of TMEM43 are associated with ARVC disease. We sought to identify non-Newfoundland individuals with TMEM43 variants among patient samples sent for genetic assessment for possible ARVC. Of 195 unrelated individuals with suspected ARVC, mutation of desmosomal proteins was seen in 28 and the p.S358L TMEM43 mutation in six. We identified a de novo p.S358L mutation in a non-Newfoundland patient and five separate rare TMEM43 (four novel) sequence variants in non-Newfoundland patients, each occurring in an evolutionarily conserved amino acid. TMEM43 mutations occur outside of the founder population of the island of Newfoundland where it was originally described. TMEM43 sequencing should be incorporated into clinical genetic testing for ARVC patients.

cardiomyopathy (ARVC) is a myocardial disease characterized by fibro-fatty replacement of right ventricular free wall myocardium and life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias. A missense mutation, c.1073C>T (p.S358L) in the transmembrane protein 43 (TMEM43) gene, has been genetically identified to cause ARVC type 5 in a founder population from Newfoundland. It is unclear whether this mutation occurs in other populations outside of this founder population or if other variants of TMEM43 are associated with ARVC disease. We sought to identify non-Newfoundland individuals with TMEM43 variants among patient samples sent for genetic assessment for possible ARVC. Of 195 unrelated individuals with suspected ARVC, mutation of desmosomal proteins was seen in 28 and the p.S358L TMEM43 mutation in six. We identified a de novo p.S358L mutation in a non-Newfoundland patient and five separate rare TMEM43 (four novel) sequence variants in non-Newfoundland patients, each occurring in an evolutionarily conserved amino acid. TMEM43 mutations occur outside of the founder population of the island of Newfoundland where it was originally described. TMEM43 sequencing should be incorporated into clinical genetic testing for ARVC patients.

A missense mutation, c.1073C>T (p.S358L) in the transmembrane protein 43 (TMEM43) gene, has been genetically identified to cause ARVC type 5 in a founder population from Newfoundland. It is unclear whether this mutation occurs in other populations outside of this founder population or if other variants of TMEM43 are associated with ARVC disease. We sought to identify non-Newfoundland individuals with TMEM43 variants among patient samples sent for genetic assessment for possible ARVC. Of 195 unrelated individuals with suspected ARVC, mutation of desmosomal proteins was seen in 28 and the p.S358L TMEM43 mutation in six. We identified a de novo p.S358L mutation in a non-Newfoundland patient and five separate rare TMEM43 (four novel) sequence variants in non-Newfoundland patients, each occurring in an evolutionarily conserved amino acid. TMEM43 mutations occur outside of the founder population of the island of Newfoundland where it was originally described. TMEM43 sequencing should be incorporated into clinical genetic testing for ARVC patients.

ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) with double mutations in transmembrane protein 43 (TMEM43). RV aneurysm and ventricular arrhythmia were detected during the fetal period. After birth, electrocardiogram showed frequent premature ventricular contractions (PVC) of left bundle branch block morphology and epsilon waves in the right-sided chest leads. Echocardiography also indicated RV aneurysm with regionally decreased systolic function. PVC disappeared after treatment with amiodarone and mexiletin.

cardiomyopathy/dysplasia (ARVC/D) (in the group of arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathies) is a common cause of sudden cardiac death in young adults. It is both clinically and genetically heterogeneous, with 12 loci (ARVC/D1-12) and eight genes identified, the majority of which encode structural proteins of cardiac desmosomes. The most recent gene identified, TMEM43, causes disease due to a missense mutation in a non-desmosomal gene (p.S358L) in 15 extended families from Newfoundland, Canada. To determine whether mutations in TMEM43 cause ARVC/D and arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy in other populations, we fully re-sequenced TMEM43 on 143 ARVC/D probands (families) from the UK and 55 probands (from 55 families) from Newfoundland.","date_created":"2018-04-17T14:01:55.799462+00:00","pmid":"23161701","modified_by":"/users/84a6e93b-5075-4dfb-9de5-a9fcde89abc9/"},"active":true,"experimentalData":[],"number_family":"","date_created":"2018-04-17T14:01:56.069239+00:00","modified_by":"/users/84a6e93b-5075-4dfb-9de5-a9fcde89abc9/"}],"@id":"/groups/9bf0a088-eea2-453f-bc92-b490740a0af5/","label":"Haywood

cardiomyopathy/dysplasia (ARVC/D) (in the group of arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathies) is a common cause of sudden cardiac death in young adults. It is both clinically and genetically heterogeneous, with 12 loci (ARVC/D1-12) and eight genes identified, the majority of which encode structural proteins of cardiac desmosomes. The most recent gene identified, TMEM43, causes disease due to a missense mutation in a non-desmosomal gene (p.S358L) in 15 extended families from Newfoundland, Canada. To determine whether mutations in TMEM43 cause ARVC/D and arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy in other populations, we fully re-sequenced TMEM43 on 143 ARVC/D probands (families) from the UK and 55 probands (from 55 families) from Newfoundland.","date_created":"2018-04-17T14:01:55.799462+00:00","pmid":"23161701","modified_by":"/users/84a6e93b-5075-4dfb-9de5-a9fcde89abc9/"},"active":true,"experimentalData":[],"number_family":"","date_created":"2018-04-17T14:01:56.069239+00:00","modified_by":"/users/84a6e93b-5075-4dfb-9de5-a9fcde89abc9/"}],"@id":"/groups/9bf0a088-eea2-453f-bc92-b490740a0af5/","label":"Haywood

cardiomyopathy/dysplasia (ARVC/D) (in the group of arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathies) is a common cause of sudden cardiac death in young adults. It is both clinically and genetically heterogeneous, with 12 loci (ARVC/D1-12) and eight genes identified, the majority of which encode structural proteins of cardiac desmosomes. The most recent gene identified, TMEM43, causes disease due to a missense mutation in a non-desmosomal gene (p.S358L) in 15 extended families from Newfoundland, Canada. To determine whether mutations in TMEM43 cause ARVC/D and arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy in other populations, we fully re-sequenced TMEM43 on 143 ARVC/D probands (families) from the UK and 55 probands (from 55 families) from Newfoundland.","date_created":"2018-04-17T14:01:55.799462+00:00","pmid":"23161701","modified_by":"/users/84a6e93b-5075-4dfb-9de5-a9fcde89abc9/"},"active":true,"experimentalData":[],"number_family":"","date_created":"2018-04-17T14:01:56.069239+00:00","modified_by":"/users/84a6e93b-5075-4dfb-9de5-a9fcde89abc9/"}],"@id":"/groups/9bf0a088-eea2-453f-bc92-b490740a0af5/","label":"Haywood

cardiomyopathy/dysplasia (ARVC/D) (in the group of arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathies) is a common cause of sudden cardiac death in young adults. It is both clinically and genetically heterogeneous, with 12 loci (ARVC/D1-12) and eight genes identified, the majority of which encode structural proteins of cardiac desmosomes. The most recent gene identified, TMEM43, causes disease due to a missense mutation in a non-desmosomal gene (p.S358L) in 15 extended families from Newfoundland, Canada. To determine whether mutations in TMEM43 cause ARVC/D and arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy in other populations, we fully re-sequenced TMEM43 on 143 ARVC/D probands (families) from the UK and 55 probands (from 55 families) from

cardiomyopathy/dysplasia (ARVC/D) (in the group of arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathies) is a common cause of sudden cardiac death in young adults. It is both clinically and genetically heterogeneous, with 12 loci (ARVC/D1-12) and eight genes identified, the majority of which encode structural proteins of cardiac desmosomes. The most recent gene identified, TMEM43, causes disease due to a missense mutation in a non-desmosomal gene (p.S358L) in 15 extended families from Newfoundland, Canada. To determine whether mutations in TMEM43 cause ARVC/D and arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy in other populations, we fully re-sequenced TMEM43 on 143 ARVC/D probands (families) from the UK and 55 probands (from 55 families) from

The Ser358Leu mutation of transmembrane protein 43 (TMEM43) was commonly identified in the patients of highly lethal and fully penetrant ARVD subtype, ARVD5. Here, we generated TMEM43 S358L mouse to explore the underlying mechanism. This mouse strain showed the classic pathologies of ARVD patients, including structural abnormalities and cardiac fibrofatty. TMEM43 S358L mutation led to hyper-activated nuclear factor \u03baB (NF-\u03baB) activation in heart tissues and primary cardiomyocyte cells. Importantly, this hyper activation of NF-\u03baB directly drove the expression of pro-fibrotic gene, transforming growth factor beta (TGF\u03b21), and enhanced downstream signal, indicating that TMEM43 S358L mutation up-regulates NF-\u03baB-TGF\u03b2 signal cascade during ARVD cardiac fibrosis.

right ventricular dysplasia/cardiomyopathy (ARVD/C) is a genetic cardiac muscle disease that accounts for approximately 30% sudden cardiac death in young adults. The Ser358Leu mutation of transmembrane protein 43 (TMEM43) was commonly identified in the patients of highly lethal and fully penetrant ARVD subtype, ARVD5. Here, we generated TMEM43 S358L mouse to explore the underlying mechanism. This mouse strain showed the classic pathologies of ARVD patients, including structural abnormalities and cardiac fibrofatty. TMEM43 S358L mutation led to hyper-activated nuclear factor \u03baB (NF-\u03baB) activation in heart tissues and primary cardiomyocyte cells.
