To date, the two unique missense variants described in a single affected individual in this initial report are the only variants associated with RYR3 and autosomal recessive congenital myopathy and the impact of these variants on protein function is unclear. Some functional evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship exists, including protein expression data and functional alteration data from ryr3 knockout mice and RyR3-depleted zebrafish. In summary, no convincing evidence for a causal role for \u200bRYR3\u200b\u200b in \u200bautosomal recessive congenital myopathy has been reported. Although this gene-disease association is supported by relevant experimental evidence, the single report implicating RYR3 in autosomal recessive congenital myopathy in humans is not sufficient to be scored as genetic evidence.","modified_by":"/users/eb8e1c8d-93d4-475a-84af-ca41436146f2/","gdm_associated":["/gdm/f8f51de7-545c-46f1-9d5f-9074cc01e3c4/"],"provisionedClassification":false,"classificationApprover":"Shannon McNulty","submitted_by":"/users/eb8e1c8d-93d4-475a-84af-ca41436146f2/"},"approvalStatus":"Approved","date_created":"2020-05-12T18:51:33.457206+00:00","resourceParent":{"gdm":{"@type":["gdm","item"],"gene":{"uuid":"2934806b-784d-4084-b060-3391348e7e18","pmids":["8276408"],"@type":["gene","item"],"previousNames":[],"nameSynonyms":[],"symbol":"RYR3","previousSymbols":[],"entrezId":"6263","@id":"/genes/RYR3/","schema_version":"1","synonyms":[],"locusType":"gene with protein product","name":"ryanodine receptor 3","status":"current","chromosome":"15q13.3","omimIds":["180903"],"hgncStatus":"Approved","hgncId":"HGNC:10485"},"active":true,"uuid":"f8f51de7-545c-46f1-9d5f-9074cc01e3c4","annotations":[{"submitted_by":{"lab":"/labs/curator/","uuid":"eb8e1c8d-93d4-475a-84af-ca41436146f2","user_status":"active","@type":["user","item"],"last_name":"McNulty","email":"shannon_mcnulty@med.unc.edu","title":"Shannon McNulty","date_created":"2019-07-03T07:00:00+00:00","affiliation":["10031","10040"],"first_name":"Shannon","@id":"/users/eb8e1c8d-93d4-475a-84af-ca41436146f2/"},"@type":["annotation","item"],"active":true,"uuid":"b9ea9b55-4682-40ec-9289-6d5223c16829","number_experimental":1,"affiliation":"10031","number_family":"","experimentalData":[{"@type":["experimental","item"],"label":"RYR3 Expression in Human Fetal and Adult Tissue","assessments":[],"active":true,"uuid":"3934e815-09c8-480c-9dc2-648208cbed67","functionalAlteration":{},"biochemicalFunction":{"geneFunctionConsistentWithPhenotype":{"phenotypeHPO":[]},"geneWithSameFunctionSameDisease":{}},"scores":[{"submitted_by":{"lab":"/labs/curator/","uuid":"eb8e1c8d-93d4-475a-84af-ca41436146f2","user_status":"active","@type":["user","item"],"last_name":"McNulty","email":"shannon_mcnulty@med.unc.edu","title":"Shannon McNulty","date_created":"2019-07-03T07:00:00+00:00","affiliation":["10031","10040"],"first_name":"Shannon","@id":"/users/eb8e1c8d-93d4-475a-84af-ca41436146f2/"},"scoreStatus":"Score","@type":["evidenceScore","item"],"evidenceType":"Experimental","caseControl_scored":[],"experimental_scored":["/experimental/3934e815-09c8-480c-9dc2-648208cbed67/"],"scoreExplanation":"These protein expression experiments suggesting enriched expression of RYR3 in fetal and adult human skeletal muscle and brain tissue are in agreement with expression enrichment reported by HPA and GTEx.

Another isoform, RyR3, has been observed recently in some mammalian skeletal muscles, but whether it participates in regulating skeletal muscle contraction is not known. The expression of RyR3 in skeletal muscles was studied in mice from late fetal stages to adult life. RyR3 was found to be expressed widely in murine skeletal muscles during the post-natal phase of muscle development, but was not detectable in muscles of adult mice, with the exception of the diaphragm and soleus muscles. RyR3 knockout mice were generated, and it was shown that skeletal muscle contraction in these mice was impaired during the first weeks after birth. In skeletal muscles isolated from newborn RyR3(-/- )mice, but not in those from adult mice, the twitch elicited by electrical stimulation and the contracture induced by caffeine were strongly depressed. These results provide the first evidence that RyR3 has a physiological role in excitation-contraction coupling of neonatal skeletal muscles. The disproportion between the low amount of RyR3 and the large impact of the RyR3 knockout suggests that this isoform contributes to the amplification of Ca2+ released by the existing population of ryanodine receptors (RyR1).","date":"1997 Dec 1;16(23):6956-63.","date_created":"2020-01-17T18:24:57.437861+00:00","journal":"The EMBO journal","doi":""}}],"expression":{"alteredExpression":{},"normalExpression":{},"organOfTissue":[]},"modified_by":{"lab":"/labs/curator/","uuid":"eb8e1c8d-93d4-475a-84af-ca41436146f2","user_status":"active","@type":["user","item"],"last_name":"McNulty","email":"shannon_mcnulty@med.unc.edu","title":"Shannon McNulty","date_created":"2019-07-03T07:00:00+00:00","affiliation":["10031","10040"],"first_name":"Shannon","@id":"/users/eb8e1c8d-93d4-475a-84af-ca41436146f2/"},"rescue":{}},{"@type":["experimental","item"],"label":"Twitch Response in Neonatal ryr3 Knockout Mice","assessments":[],"active":true,"uuid":"8346ad40-e126-425a-ac48-15ccc722f04b","functionalAlteration":{"functionalAlterationType":"Non-patient cells","evidenceInPaper":"Figure 3","descriptionOfGeneAlteration":"The ryr3 gene was disrupted by homologous recombination with a replacement vector containing the neomycin resistance gene in the sixth exon of ryr3, eliminating the carboxy\u2010terminus of the protein which includes the transmembrane segments involved in formation of the pore region of the Ca2+ channel and generating a non\u2010functional ryr3 allele.

This subcellular membrane specialization is necessary for proper intracellular signaling and any alterations in its architecture may lead to neuromuscular disorders. In this study, we present evidence that patients with recessive RYR1-related congenital myopathies due to primary RyR1 deficiency also exhibit downregulation of the alfa 1 subunit of the DHPR and show disruption of the spatial organization of the EC coupling machinery. We created a cellular RyR1 knockdown model using immortalized human myoblasts transfected with RyR1 siRNA and confirm that knocking down RyR1 concomitantly downregulates not only the DHPR but also the expression of other proteins involved in EC coupling. Unexpectedly, this was paralleled by the upregulation of inositol-1,4,5-triphosphate receptors; functionally however, upregulation of the latter Ca(2+) channels did not compensate for the lack of RyR1-mediated Ca(2+) release. These results indicate that in some patients, RyR1 deficiency concomitantly alters the expression pattern of several proteins involved in calcium homeostasis and that this may influence the manifestation of these diseases.","date":"2013 Jul;34(7):986-96.","date_created":"2020-01-17T19:01:40.543227+00:00","journal":"Human

Despite the almost complete disappearance of PJF and Ca(2+) sparks in morphant fibers, these fibers looked structurally normal and the swimming behavior of the larvae was not affected. This paper provides important evidence that RyR3 is the main constituent of the PJF and is the main contributor to the SR Ca(2+) flux underlying Ca(2+) sparks detected in fully differentiated frog and fish fibers.
