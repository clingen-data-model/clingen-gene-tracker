Mutations in several genes encoding desmosomal proteins have been identified in ARVC. We speculated that \u03b1T-catenin, encoded by CTNNA3, might also carry mutations in ARVC patients. Alpha-T-catenin binds plakophilins and this binding contributes to the formation of the area composita, which strengthens cell-cell adhesion in contractile

Mutations in several genes encoding desmosomal proteins have been identified in ARVC. We speculated that \u03b1T-catenin, encoded by CTNNA3, might also carry mutations in ARVC patients. Alpha-T-catenin binds plakophilins and this binding contributes to the formation of the area composita, which strengthens cell-cell adhesion in contractile cardiomyocytes.","modified_by":"/users/9542c088-e65e-4890-bb8e-a6647811b34e/","submitted_by":"/users/9542c088-e65e-4890-bb8e-a6647811b34e/","date_created":"2018-09-14T06:57:38.407265+00:00","title":"Mutations

However, recent morphological and molecular data indicate a mixing of adherens junctional and desmosomal components, resulting in a 'hybrid adhering junction' or 'area composita'. The \u03b1-catenin family member \u03b1T-catenin, part of the N-cadherin-catenin adhesion complex in the heart, is the only \u03b1-catenin that interacts with the desmosomal protein plakophilin-2 (PKP2). Thus, it has been postulated that \u03b1T-catenin might serve as a molecular integrator of the two adhesion complexes in the area composita. To investigate the role of \u03b1T-catenin in the heart, gene targeting technology was used to delete the Ctnna3 gene, encoding \u03b1T-catenin, in the mouse. The \u03b1T-catenin-null mice are viable and fertile; however, the animals exhibit progressive cardiomyopathy. Adherens junctional and desmosomal proteins were unaffected by loss of \u03b1T-catenin, with the exception of the desmosomal protein PKP2. Immunogold labeling at the ICD demonstrated in the \u03b1T-catenin-null heart a preferential reduction of PKP2 at the area composita compared with the desmosome. Furthermore, gap junction protein Cx43 was reduced at the ICD, including its colocalization with N-cadherin. Gap junction remodeling in \u03b1T-catenin-knockout hearts was associated with an increased incidence of ventricular arrhythmias after acute ischemia. This novel animal model demonstrates for the first time how perturbation in \u03b1T-catenin can affect both PKP2 and Cx43 and thereby highlights the importance of understanding the crosstalk between the junctional proteins of the ICD and its implications for arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy.","modified_by":"/users/9542c088-e65e-4890-bb8e-a6647811b34e/","submitted_by":{"email":"r.h.lekanne@amc.uva.nl","user_status":"active","first_name":"Ronald","@id":"/users/9542c088-e65e-4890-bb8e-a6647811b34e/","title":"Ronald

mechano-electrical coupling in the heart consists of three distinct junctional complexes: adherens junctions, desmosomes and gap junctions. However, recent morphological and molecular data indicate a mixing of adherens junctional and desmosomal components, resulting in a 'hybrid adhering junction' or 'area composita'. The \u03b1-catenin family member \u03b1T-catenin, part of the N-cadherin-catenin adhesion complex in the heart, is the only \u03b1-catenin that interacts with the desmosomal protein plakophilin-2 (PKP2). Thus, it has been postulated that \u03b1T-catenin might serve as a molecular integrator of the two adhesion complexes in the area composita. To investigate the role of \u03b1T-catenin in the heart, gene targeting technology was used to delete the Ctnna3 gene, encoding \u03b1T-catenin, in the mouse. The \u03b1T-catenin-null mice are viable and fertile; however, the animals exhibit progressive cardiomyopathy. Adherens junctional and desmosomal proteins were unaffected by loss of \u03b1T-catenin, with the exception of the desmosomal protein PKP2. Immunogold labeling at the ICD demonstrated in the \u03b1T-catenin-null heart a preferential reduction of PKP2 at the area composita compared with the desmosome. Furthermore, gap junction protein Cx43 was reduced at the ICD, including its colocalization with N-cadherin. Gap junction remodeling in \u03b1T-catenin-knockout hearts was associated with an increased incidence of ventricular arrhythmias after acute ischemia. This novel animal model demonstrates for the first time how perturbation in \u03b1T-catenin can affect both PKP2 and Cx43 and thereby highlights the importance of understanding the crosstalk between the junctional proteins of the ICD and its implications for arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy.","modified_by":"/users/9542c088-e65e-4890-bb8e-a6647811b34e/","submitted_by":"/users/9542c088-e65e-4890-bb8e-a6647811b34e/","date_created":"2018-09-14T08:26:57.976047+00:00","title":"Loss of \u03b1T-catenin alters the hybrid adhering junctions in the heart and leads to dilated cardiomyopathy and ventricular arrhythmia following acute ischemia.","schema_version":"1","@type":["article","item"]},"date_created":"2018-09-14T08:26:58.375008+00:00","experimentalData":["/experimental/a7357dc1-7a74-4639-b294-1b01d4f5b244/"],"groups":[],"number_family":"","uuid":"c49c66ae-1a54-45b6-bcdf-55f9751475c6","status":"in progress"}],"assessments":[],"rescue":{},"schema_version":"8","modelSystems":{"phenotypeHPO":"HP:0011663","descriptionOfGeneAlteration":"KO","explanation":"not completely similar","evidenceInPaper":"whole paper is about it","modelSystemsType":"Non-human model organism","nonHumanModel":"Mouse (Mus musculus) 10090","phenotypeHPOObserved":"HP:0001644"},"evidenceType":"Model Systems","modified_by":{"email":"r.h.lekanne@amc.uva.nl","user_status":"active","first_name":"Ronald","@id":"/users/9542c088-e65e-4890-bb8e-a6647811b34e/","title":"Ronald Lekanne dit Deprez","date_created":"2018-03-20T07:00:00+00:00","uuid":"9542c088-e65e-4890-bb8e-a6647811b34e","lab":"/labs/curator/","last_name":"Lekanne dit Deprez","affiliation":["10003","10035"],"@type":["user","item"]},"submitted_by":{"email":"r.h.lekanne@amc.uva.nl","user_status":"active","first_name":"Ronald","@id":"/users/9542c088-e65e-4890-bb8e-a6647811b34e/","title":"Ronald Lekanne dit Deprez","date_created":"2018-03-20T07:00:00+00:00","uuid":"9542c088-e65e-4890-bb8e-a6647811b34e","lab":"/labs/curator/","last_name":"Lekanne dit Deprez","affiliation":["10003","10035"],"@type":["user","item"]},"active":true,"@type":["experimental","item"],"proteinInteractions":{},"functionalAlteration":{},"@id":"/experimental/a7357dc1-7a74-4639-b294-1b01d4f5b244/","label":"Germline knockout of alphaT-catenin in the mouse","last_modified":"2018-09-14T08:34:24.793305+00:00","date_created":"2018-09-14T08:34:24.787846+00:00","expression":{"alteredExpression":{},"normalExpression":{},"organOfTissue":[]},"uuid":"a7357dc1-7a74-4639-b294-1b01d4f5b244","affiliation":"10003","status":"in progress"}],"groups":[],"number_family":"","uuid":"c49c66ae-1a54-45b6-bcdf-55f9751475c6","status":"in progress"},{"modified_by":"/users/9542c088-e65e-4890-bb8e-a6647811b34e/","families":[],"active":true,"@id":"/evidence/aa8be222-5a99-4ae3-9274-5560c2e9f3c4/","submitted_by":{"email":"r.h.lekanne@amc.uva.nl","user_status":"active","first_name":"Ronald","@id":"/users/9542c088-e65e-4890-bb8e-a6647811b34e/","title":"Ronald Lekanne dit Deprez","date_created":"2018-03-20T07:00:00+00:00","uuid":"9542c088-e65e-4890-bb8e-a6647811b34e","lab":"/labs/curator/","last_name":"Lekanne dit Deprez","affiliation":["10003","10035"],"@type":["user","item"]},"schema_version":"4","affiliation":"10003","number_experimental":"","number_group":"","last_modified":"2019-07-11T16:50:19.780142+00:00","individuals":[],"associatedGdm":["/gdm/f8a3ab80-4c02-4f66-bfe8-c1d07ecd801d/"],"@type":["annotation","item"],"number_individual":"","article":{"date":"2011 Apr;15(4):267-71.","journal":"Genetic testing and molecular biomarkers","active":true,"@id":"/articles/21254927/","uuid":"2794d815-e7b4-4522-9d69-4353509b8a87","doi":"","authors":["Christensen AH","Benn M","Tybj\u00e6rg-Hansen A","Haunso S","Svendsen JH"],"pmcid":"","last_modified":"2019-07-11T16:50:19.431025+00:00","pmid":"21254927","abstract":"Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) has been associated with mutations in genes encoding cellular adhesion proteins.

Our comprehensive mutation scanning did not identify any disease-causing mutations. Thirty-five sequence variants were found, including one rare nonsynonymous variant of unknown significance (CTNNA3 A689V). Fourteen of the variants were novel. In conclusion, in our cohort of a limited size, no mutations were identified in the three studied candidate genes despite their involvement in formation and maintenance of the intercalated disk.

21254927, 224213630). In one paper the CTNNA3 gene was analyzed in 76 ARVD probands that were negative for PKP2, DSP, DSG2, DSC2, and JUP. In one of the probands the heterozygous NM_013266.3(CTNNA3):c.281T>A p.(Val94Asp) variant was found. This variant was not observed in 245296 reference alleles from gnomAD and was not present in both healthy parents and brother suggesting that the variant occurred de novo. Unfortunately no information was given about paternity testing or family history for ARVD. Another proband showed the heterozygous variant NM_013266.3(CTNNA3):c.2296_2298del p.(Leu766del). This variant was not found in 30971 reference alleles from gnomAD but was inherited from her father that only showed a mild right ventricular dilation.
