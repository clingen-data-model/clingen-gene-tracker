This was first proposed by Tomlinson et al in 2002 (PMID: 11865300). Numerous genetic studies have reported familial segregation of FH variants in families with leiomyomatosis or renal cell cancer. Affected individuals with heterozygous mutations had decreased fumarate hydratase enzyme activity in their lymphoblastoid cell lines although penetrance varies among individuals with similar decreases in FH activity. Tumors from HLRCC patients with a FH germline heterozygous mutations presented markedly reduced enzyme activity due to a second hit on FH, compared with tumors with similar histology from non HLRCC patients. There are substantial other functional assays demonstrating deficiency of FH activity and abnormality in smooth muscle differentiation. In summary, FH is definitively associated with HLRCC. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time.","approvalDate":"2020-05-14T00:23:34.007Z","approvalSubmitter":"Xi Luo"},"date_created":"2020-05-14T00:23:38.213108+00:00","@type":["snapshot","item"],"resourceParent":{"gdm":{"variantPathogenicity":[{"assessments":[],"@id":"/pathogenicity/e25c1a38-30bc-46d9-805f-64885cec1ac0/","modified_by":"/users/0588049b-24a4-44db-aff6-9110cd9a86b8/","denovoType":"","date_created":"2019-08-29T23:44:26.209186+00:00","numberOfAssessment":"","@type":["pathogenicity","item"],"associatedGdm":["/gdm/ca78c869-d67c-40c8-8c70-fcc52a4d4744/"],"variant":{"associatedInterpretations":[],"@id":"/variants/64dddcdb-d5f9-4e85-bf21-df900d47b9a7/","clinVarSCVs":[],"clinvarVariantId":"16232","status":"in progress","molecularConsequenceList":[{"soId":"SO:0001587","term":"nonsense","hgvsName":"NM_000143.3:c.301C>T"}],"variationType":"single nucleotide variant","schema_version":"6","associatedPathogenicities":["/pathogenicity/e25c1a38-30bc-46d9-805f-64885cec1ac0/"],"uuid":"64dddcdb-d5f9-4e85-bf21-df900d47b9a7","carId":"","dbSNPIds":["121913120"],"modified_by":"/users/0588049b-24a4-44db-aff6-9110cd9a86b8/","date_created":"2018-05-29T03:39:30.728257+00:00","clinVarRCVs":[],"@type":["variant","item"],"otherDescription":"","molecular_consequence":"nonsense","variation_type":"single nucleotide variant","submitted_by":{"user_status":"active","last_name":"Cao","date_created":"2018-04-02T07:00:00+00:00","@id":"/users/0588049b-24a4-44db-aff6-9110cd9a86b8/","lab":"/labs/curator/","@type":["user","item"],"affiliation":["10023"],"title":"Ye Cao","uuid":"0588049b-24a4-44db-aff6-9110cd9a86b8","first_name":"Ye","email":"ye.cao@bcm.edu"},"variant_identifier":"16232","last_modified":"2018-05-29T03:39:30.728243+00:00","maneTranscriptTitle":"","hgvsNames":{"others":["NG_012338.1:g.11075C>T","NM_000143.3:c.301C>T","NP_000134.2:p.Arg101Ter","LRG_504p1:p.Arg101Ter","LRG_504:g.11075C>T","LRG_504t1:c.301C>T"],"GRCh38":"NC_000001.11:g.241513680G>A","GRCh37":"NC_000001.10:g.241676980G>A"},"clinvarVariantTitle":"NM_000143.3(FH):c.301C>T (p.Arg101Ter)","source":"ClinVar"},"schema_version":"2","comment":"","last_modified":"2019-08-29T23:44:26.210025+00:00","affiliation":"10023","submitted_by":{"user_status":"active","last_name":"Cao","date_created":"2018-04-02T07:00:00+00:00","@id":"/users/0588049b-24a4-44db-aff6-9110cd9a86b8/","lab":"/labs/curator/","@type":["user","item"],"affiliation":["10023"],"title":"Ye Cao","uuid":"0588049b-24a4-44db-aff6-9110cd9a86b8","first_name":"Ye","email":"ye.cao@bcm.edu"},"uuid":"e25c1a38-30bc-46d9-805f-64885cec1ac0"}],"@id":"/gdm/ca78c869-d67c-40c8-8c70-fcc52a4d4744/","date_created":"2018-04-08T17:05:47.770198+00:00","number_provisional":"1","modeCode":"0","audit":{},"annotations":[{"modified_by":"/users/0588049b-24a4-44db-aff6-9110cd9a86b8/","@id":"/evidence/b1210a76-eb66-49d9-88e3-ec99223e152a/","affiliation":"10023","last_modified":"2018-04-08T17:07:00.215554+00:00","status":"in progress","date_created":"2018-04-08T17:07:00.215804+00:00","@type":["annotation","item"],"associatedGdm":["/gdm/ca78c869-d67c-40c8-8c70-fcc52a4d4744/"],"individuals":[],"groups":[],"schema_version":"4","number_group":"","article":{"schema_version":"1","@id":"/articles/11283798/","modified_by":"/users/0588049b-24a4-44db-aff6-9110cd9a86b8/","authors":["Alam NA","Bevan S","Churchman M","Barclay E","Barker K","Jaeger EE","Nelson HM","Healy E","Pembroke AC","Friedmann PS","Dalziel K","Calonje E","Anderson J","August PJ","Davies MG","Felix R","Munro CS","Murdoch M","Rendall J","Kennedy S","Leigh IM","Kelsell DP","Tomlinson IP","Houlston RS"],"date_created":"2018-04-08T17:07:00.104544+00:00","@type":["article","item"],"journal":"American journal of human genetics","doi":"","pmid":"11283798","submitted_by":{"user_status":"active","last_name":"Cao","date_created":"2018-04-02T07:00:00+00:00","@id":"/users/0588049b-24a4-44db-aff6-9110cd9a86b8/","lab":"/labs/curator/","@type":["user","item"],"affiliation":["10023"],"title":"Ye Cao","uuid":"0588049b-24a4-44db-aff6-9110cd9a86b8","first_name":"Ye","email":"ye.cao@bcm.edu"},"pmcid":"","last_modified":"2018-04-08T17:07:00.104557+00:00","abstract":"Dominant transmission of multiple uterine and cutaneous smooth-muscle tumors is seen in the disorder multiple leiomyomatosis (ML).

Allelic-loss studies of tumors indicated that MCUL1 may act as a tumor suppressor.

(fibroids) are common and clinically important tumors, but little is known about their etiology and pathogenesis. We previously mapped a gene that predisposes to multiple fibroids, cutaneous leiomyomata and renal cell carcinoma to chromosome 1q42.3-q43 (refs 4-6). Here we show, through a combination of mapping critical recombinants, identifying individuals with germline mutations and screening known and predicted transcripts, that this gene encodes fumarate hydratase, an enzyme of the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Leiomyomatosis-associated mutations are predicted to result in absent or truncated protein, or substitutions or deletions of highly conserved amino acids. Activity of fumarate hydratase is reduced in lymphoblastoid cells from individuals with leiomyomatosis. This enzyme acts as a tumor suppressor in familial leiomyomata, and its measured activity is very low or absent in tumors from individuals with leiomyomatosis. Mutations in FH also occur in the recessive condition fumarate hydratase deficiency, and some parents of people with this condition are susceptible to leiomyomata. Thus, heterozygous and homozygous or compound heterozygous mutants have very different clinical phenotypes. Our results provide clues to the pathogenesis of fibroids and emphasize the importance of mutations of housekeeping and mitochondrial proteins in the pathogenesis of common types of tumor.","date":"2002 Apr;30(4):406-10.","title":"Germline mutations in FH predispose to dominantly inherited uterine fibroids, skin leiomyomata and papillary renal cell

fumarate hydratase (FH, fumarase) gene are found in the recessive FH deficiency syndrome and in dominantly inherited susceptibility to multiple cutaneous and uterine leiomyomatosis (MCUL). We have previously reported a number of germline FH mutations from MCUL patients. In this study, we report additional FH mutations in MCUL and FH deficiency patients. Mutations can readily be found in about 75% of MCUL cases and most cases of FH deficiency. Some of the more common FH mutations are probably derived from founding individuals. Protein-truncating FH mutations are functionally null alleles. Disease-associated missense FH changes map to highly conserved residues, mostly in or around the enzyme's active site or activation site; we predict that these mutations severely compromise enzyme function. The mutation spectra in FH deficiency and MCUL are similar, although in the latter mutations tend to occur earlier in the gene and, perhaps, are more likely to result in a truncated or absent protein. We have found that not all mutation-carrier parents of FH deficiency children have a strong predisposition to leiomyomata. We have confirmed that renal carcinoma is sometimes part of MCUL, as part of the variant hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cancer (HLRCC) syndrome, and have shown that these cancers may have either type II papillary or collecting duct morphology. We have found no association between the type or site of FH mutation and any aspect of the MCUL phenotype. Biochemical assay for reduced FH functional activity in the germline of MCUL patients can indicate carriers of FH mutations with high sensitivity and specificity, and can detect reduced FH activity in some patients without detectable FH mutations. We conclude that MCUL is probably a genetically homogeneous tumour predisposition syndrome, primarily resulting from absent or severely reduced fumarase activity, with currently unknown functional consequences for the smooth muscle or kidney cell.","date":"2003 Jun 1;12(11):1241-52.","title":"Genetic and functional analyses of FH mutations in multiple cutaneous and uterine leiomyomatosis,

(fibroids) are common and clinically important tumors, but little is known about their etiology and pathogenesis. We previously mapped a gene that predisposes to multiple fibroids, cutaneous leiomyomata and renal cell carcinoma to chromosome 1q42.3-q43 (refs 4-6). Here we show, through a combination of mapping critical recombinants, identifying individuals with germline mutations and screening known and predicted transcripts, that this gene encodes fumarate hydratase, an enzyme of the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Leiomyomatosis-associated mutations are predicted to result in absent or truncated protein, or substitutions or deletions of highly conserved amino acids. Activity of fumarate hydratase is reduced in lymphoblastoid cells from individuals with leiomyomatosis. This enzyme acts as a tumor suppressor in familial leiomyomata, and its measured activity is very low or absent in tumors from individuals with leiomyomatosis. Mutations in FH also occur in the recessive condition fumarate hydratase deficiency, and some parents of people with this condition are susceptible to leiomyomata. Thus, heterozygous and homozygous or compound heterozygous mutants have very different clinical phenotypes. Our results provide clues to the pathogenesis of fibroids and emphasize the importance of mutations of housekeeping and mitochondrial proteins in the pathogenesis of common types of tumor.","date":"2002 Apr;30(4):406-10.","title":"Germline mutations in FH predispose to dominantly inherited uterine fibroids, skin leiomyomata and papillary renal cell

fumarate hydratase (FH, fumarase) gene are found in the recessive FH deficiency syndrome and in dominantly inherited susceptibility to multiple cutaneous and uterine leiomyomatosis (MCUL). We have previously reported a number of germline FH mutations from MCUL patients. In this study, we report additional FH mutations in MCUL and FH deficiency patients. Mutations can readily be found in about 75% of MCUL cases and most cases of FH deficiency. Some of the more common FH mutations are probably derived from founding individuals. Protein-truncating FH mutations are functionally null alleles. Disease-associated missense FH changes map to highly conserved residues, mostly in or around the enzyme's active site or activation site; we predict that these mutations severely compromise enzyme function. The mutation spectra in FH deficiency and MCUL are similar, although in the latter mutations tend to occur earlier in the gene and, perhaps, are more likely to result in a truncated or absent protein. We have found that not all mutation-carrier parents of FH deficiency children have a strong predisposition to leiomyomata. We have confirmed that renal carcinoma is sometimes part of MCUL, as part of the variant hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cancer (HLRCC) syndrome, and have shown that these cancers may have either type II papillary or collecting duct morphology. We have found no association between the type or site of FH mutation and any aspect of the MCUL phenotype. Biochemical assay for reduced FH functional activity in the germline of MCUL patients can indicate carriers of FH mutations with high sensitivity and specificity, and can detect reduced FH activity in some patients without detectable FH mutations. We conclude that MCUL is probably a genetically homogeneous tumour predisposition syndrome, primarily resulting from absent or severely reduced fumarase activity, with currently unknown functional consequences for the smooth muscle or kidney cell.","date":"2003 Jun 1;12(11):1241-52.","title":"Genetic and functional analyses of FH mutations in multiple cutaneous and uterine leiomyomatosis,

(fibroids) are common and clinically important tumors, but little is known about their etiology and pathogenesis. We previously mapped a gene that predisposes to multiple fibroids, cutaneous leiomyomata and renal cell carcinoma to chromosome 1q42.3-q43 (refs 4-6). Here we show, through a combination of mapping critical recombinants, identifying individuals with germline mutations and screening known and predicted transcripts, that this gene encodes fumarate hydratase, an enzyme of the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Leiomyomatosis-associated mutations are predicted to result in absent or truncated protein, or substitutions or deletions of highly conserved amino acids. Activity of fumarate hydratase is reduced in lymphoblastoid cells from individuals with leiomyomatosis. This enzyme acts as a tumor suppressor in familial leiomyomata, and its measured activity is very low or absent in tumors from individuals with leiomyomatosis. Mutations in FH also occur in the recessive condition fumarate hydratase deficiency, and some parents of people with this condition are susceptible to leiomyomata. Thus, heterozygous and homozygous or compound heterozygous mutants have very different clinical phenotypes. Our results provide clues to the pathogenesis of fibroids and emphasize the importance of mutations of housekeeping and mitochondrial proteins in the pathogenesis of common types of tumor.","date":"2002 Apr;30(4):406-10.","title":"Germline mutations in FH predispose to dominantly inherited uterine fibroids, skin leiomyomata and papillary renal cell

fumarate hydratase (FH, fumarase) gene are found in the recessive FH deficiency syndrome and in dominantly inherited susceptibility to multiple cutaneous and uterine leiomyomatosis (MCUL). We have previously reported a number of germline FH mutations from MCUL patients. In this study, we report additional FH mutations in MCUL and FH deficiency patients. Mutations can readily be found in about 75% of MCUL cases and most cases of FH deficiency. Some of the more common FH mutations are probably derived from founding individuals. Protein-truncating FH mutations are functionally null alleles. Disease-associated missense FH changes map to highly conserved residues, mostly in or around the enzyme's active site or activation site; we predict that these mutations severely compromise enzyme function. The mutation spectra in FH deficiency and MCUL are similar, although in the latter mutations tend to occur earlier in the gene and, perhaps, are more likely to result in a truncated or absent protein. We have found that not all mutation-carrier parents of FH deficiency children have a strong predisposition to leiomyomata. We have confirmed that renal carcinoma is sometimes part of MCUL, as part of the variant hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cancer (HLRCC) syndrome, and have shown that these cancers may have either type II papillary or collecting duct morphology. We have found no association between the type or site of FH mutation and any aspect of the MCUL phenotype. Biochemical assay for reduced FH functional activity in the germline of MCUL patients can indicate carriers of FH mutations with high sensitivity and specificity, and can detect reduced FH activity in some patients without detectable FH mutations. We conclude that MCUL is probably a genetically homogeneous tumour predisposition syndrome, primarily resulting from absent or severely reduced fumarase activity, with currently unknown functional consequences for the smooth muscle or kidney cell.","date":"2003 Jun 1;12(11):1241-52.","title":"Genetic and functional analyses of FH mutations in multiple cutaneous and uterine leiomyomatosis, hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cancer, and fumarate hydratase deficiency.","uuid":"41b81647-f421-4123-b93b-09631ebdd8b5","active":true}]}],"groups":[],"schema_version":"4","number_group":"","article":{"schema_version":"1","@id":"/articles/11865300/","modified_by":"/users/0588049b-24a4-44db-aff6-9110cd9a86b8/","authors":["Tomlinson IP","Alam NA","Rowan AJ","Barclay E","Jaeger EE","Kelsell D","Leigh I","Gorman P","Lamlum H","Rahman S","Roylance RR","Olpin S","Bevan S","Barker K","Hearle N","Houlston RS","Kiuru M","Lehtonen R","Karhu A","Vilkki S","Laiho P","Eklund C","Vierimaa O","Aittom\u00e4ki K","Hietala M","Sistonen P","Paetau A","Salovaara R","Herva R","Launonen V","Aaltonen LA","Multiple Leiomyoma Consortium"],"date_created":"2018-04-08T17:56:31.704901+00:00","@type":["article","item"],"journal":"Nature genetics","doi":"","pmid":"11865300","submitted_by":{"user_status":"active","last_name":"Cao","date_created":"2018-04-02T07:00:00+00:00","@id":"/users/0588049b-24a4-44db-aff6-9110cd9a86b8/","lab":"/labs/curator/","@type":["user","item"],"affiliation":["10023"],"title":"Ye Cao","uuid":"0588049b-24a4-44db-aff6-9110cd9a86b8","first_name":"Ye","email":"ye.cao@bcm.edu"},"pmcid":"","last_modified":"2018-04-08T17:56:31.704915+00:00","abstract":"Uterine leiomyomata (fibroids) are common and clinically important tumors, but little is known about their etiology and pathogenesis. We previously mapped a gene that predisposes to multiple fibroids, cutaneous leiomyomata and renal cell carcinoma to chromosome 1q42.3-q43 (refs 4-6). Here we show, through a combination of mapping critical recombinants, identifying individuals with germline mutations and screening known and predicted transcripts, that this gene encodes fumarate hydratase, an enzyme of the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Leiomyomatosis-associated mutations are predicted to result in absent or truncated protein, or substitutions or deletions of highly conserved amino acids. Activity of fumarate hydratase is reduced in lymphoblastoid cells from individuals with leiomyomatosis. This enzyme acts as a tumor suppressor in familial leiomyomata, and its measured activity is very low or absent in tumors from individuals with leiomyomatosis. Mutations in FH also occur in the recessive condition fumarate hydratase deficiency, and some parents of people with this condition are susceptible to leiomyomata. Thus, heterozygous and homozygous or compound heterozygous mutants have very different clinical phenotypes. Our results provide clues to the pathogenesis of fibroids and emphasize the importance of mutations of housekeeping and mitochondrial proteins in the pathogenesis of common types of tumor.","date":"2002 Apr;30(4):406-10.","title":"Germline mutations in FH predispose to dominantly inherited uterine fibroids, skin leiomyomata and papillary renal cell

(fibroids) are common and clinically important tumors, but little is known about their etiology and pathogenesis. We previously mapped a gene that predisposes to multiple fibroids, cutaneous leiomyomata and renal cell carcinoma to chromosome 1q42.3-q43 (refs 4-6). Here we show, through a combination of mapping critical recombinants, identifying individuals with germline mutations and screening known and predicted transcripts, that this gene encodes fumarate hydratase, an enzyme of the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Leiomyomatosis-associated mutations are predicted to result in absent or truncated protein, or substitutions or deletions of highly conserved amino acids. Activity of fumarate hydratase is reduced in lymphoblastoid cells from individuals with leiomyomatosis. This enzyme acts as a tumor suppressor in familial leiomyomata, and its measured activity is very low or absent in tumors from individuals with leiomyomatosis. Mutations in FH also occur in the recessive condition fumarate hydratase deficiency, and some parents of people with this condition are susceptible to leiomyomata. Thus, heterozygous and homozygous or compound heterozygous mutants have very different clinical phenotypes. Our results provide clues to the pathogenesis of fibroids and emphasize the importance of mutations of housekeeping and mitochondrial proteins in the pathogenesis of common types of tumor.","date":"2002 Apr;30(4):406-10.","title":"Germline mutations in FH predispose to dominantly inherited uterine fibroids, skin leiomyomata and papillary renal cell cancer.","uuid":"290d7736-e725-4cd2-8482-e20dae4ba81d","active":true},"submitted_by":"/users/0588049b-24a4-44db-aff6-9110cd9a86b8/","active":true,"number_individual":3,"number_family":1,"families":["/families/92a65210-02eb-4fc6-b931-366f032845c5/"],"uuid":"adf4709f-4811-4159-908f-de0d9d5d1c15","experimentalData":["/experimental/c2070579-009c-43bf-9d9c-9c7b45f71eda/"],"number_experimental":1}],"associatedGroups":[],"schema_version":"7","hpoIdInDiagnosis":["HP:0007620","HP:0000131"],"label":"UK Family 304","hpoIdInElimination":[],"uuid":"92a65210-02eb-4fc6-b931-366f032845c5","countryOfOrigin":"United Kingdom","method":{"previousTesting":true,"additionalInformation":"","specificMutationsGenotypedMethod":"Use PCR to screen 6 known genes and over 50 predicted gene or transcripts  in the critical region.

(fibroids) are common and clinically important tumors, but little is known about their etiology and pathogenesis. We previously mapped a gene that predisposes to multiple fibroids, cutaneous leiomyomata and renal cell carcinoma to chromosome 1q42.3-q43 (refs 4-6). Here we show, through a combination of mapping critical recombinants, identifying individuals with germline mutations and screening known and predicted transcripts, that this gene encodes fumarate hydratase, an enzyme of the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Leiomyomatosis-associated mutations are predicted to result in absent or truncated protein, or substitutions or deletions of highly conserved amino acids. Activity of fumarate hydratase is reduced in lymphoblastoid cells from individuals with leiomyomatosis. This enzyme acts as a tumor suppressor in familial leiomyomata, and its measured activity is very low or absent in tumors from individuals with leiomyomatosis. Mutations in FH also occur in the recessive condition fumarate hydratase deficiency, and some parents of people with this condition are susceptible to leiomyomata. Thus, heterozygous and homozygous or compound heterozygous mutants have very different clinical phenotypes. Our results provide clues to the pathogenesis of fibroids and emphasize the importance of mutations of housekeeping and mitochondrial proteins in the pathogenesis of common types of tumor.","date":"2002 Apr;30(4):406-10.","title":"Germline mutations in FH predispose to dominantly inherited uterine fibroids, skin leiomyomata and papillary renal cell

The main objective of our study was to evaluate clinical and genetic data from families suspected of HLRCC on a nationwide level. All families referred for FH mutation analysis in the Netherlands were assessed. We performed FH sequence analysis and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification. Families with similar FH mutations were examined for haplotype sharing. In 14 out of 33 families, we identified 11 different pathogenic FH germline mutations, including 4 novel mutations and 1 whole-gene deletion. Clinical data were available for 35 FH mutation carriers. Cutaneous leiomyomas were present in all FH mutation carriers older than 40 years of age. Eleven out of 21 female FH mutation carriers underwent surgical treatment for symptomatic uterine leiomyomas at an average of 35 years. Two FH mutation carriers had papillary type 2 renal cancer and Wilms' tumour, respectively. We evaluated the relevance of our findings for clinical practice and have proposed clinical diagnostic criteria, indications for FH mutation analysis and recommendations for management.","date":"2011

and papillary type 2 renal cancer. The main objective of our study was to evaluate clinical and genetic data from families suspected of HLRCC on a nationwide level. All families referred for FH mutation analysis in the Netherlands were assessed. We performed FH sequence analysis and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification. Families with similar FH mutations were examined for haplotype sharing. In 14 out of 33 families, we identified 11 different pathogenic FH germline mutations, including 4 novel mutations and 1 whole-gene deletion. Clinical data were available for 35 FH mutation carriers. Cutaneous leiomyomas were present in all FH mutation carriers older than 40 years of age. Eleven out of 21 female FH mutation carriers underwent surgical treatment for symptomatic uterine leiomyomas at an average of 35 years. Two FH mutation carriers had papillary type 2 renal cancer and Wilms' tumour, respectively. We evaluated the relevance of our findings for clinical practice and have proposed clinical diagnostic criteria, indications for FH mutation analysis and recommendations for management.","date":"2011

hydratase (FH) germline mutations cause hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell cancer (HLRCC), an autosomal dominant syndrome characterized by multiple cutaneous piloleiomyomas, uterine leiomyomas and papillary type 2 renal cancer. The main objective of our study was to evaluate clinical and genetic data from families suspected of HLRCC on a nationwide level. All families referred for FH mutation analysis in the Netherlands were assessed. We performed FH sequence analysis and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification. Families with similar FH mutations were examined for haplotype sharing. In 14 out of 33 families, we identified 11 different pathogenic FH germline mutations, including 4 novel mutations and 1 whole-gene deletion. Clinical data were available for 35 FH mutation carriers. Cutaneous leiomyomas were present in all FH mutation carriers older than 40 years of age. Eleven out of 21 female FH mutation carriers underwent surgical treatment for symptomatic uterine leiomyomas at an average of 35 years. Two FH mutation carriers had papillary type 2 renal cancer and Wilms' tumour, respectively. We evaluated the relevance of our findings for clinical practice and have proposed clinical diagnostic criteria, indications for FH mutation analysis and recommendations for management.","date":"2011

renal cell carcinoma (HLRCC) is an autosomal dominant familial syndrome characterized by the development of cutaneous and uterine leiomyomas as well as renal tumors. The mutation of this condition has been identified in the fumarate hydratase (FH, 1q42.3-q43) gene. The histology of the renal cancers has not been well described or illustrated because of the newness of the syndrome. We reviewed 40 renal tumors resected from 38 patients belonging to HLRCC families with proven fumarate hydratase germline mutation. Patients ranged in age from 17 to 75 years of age. Tumors were unilateral in all but 2 cases. The size of the tumors varied between 2.3 and 20 cm and there was no laterality preference. Several different architectural patterns were recognized: papillary (25 cases), tubulo-papillary (8 cases), tubular (2 cases), and solid (1 case). Mixed patterns were also present in 4 cases. The most important histologic feature of these neoplasms, which we believe to be the hallmark of the HLRCC tumors, is the presence of a characteristic large nucleus with a very prominent inclusion like orangiophilic or eosinophilic nucleolus, surrounded by a clear halo. Immunohistochemical studies did not provide a specific marker for these tumors, however, loss of heterozygosity at 1q32 and 1q42-44 was frequently found. These tumors are associated with poor prognosis and frequent spread to regional lymph nodes. At the moment, morphology is the best tool to recognize these tumors. Proper diagnosis of this syndrome by the pathologist may assist in early detection of these tumors.","date":"2007 Oct;31(10):1578-85.","title":"The morphologic spectrum of kidney tumors in hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell carcinoma (HLRCC) syndrome.","uuid":"8efe543c-5929-4f6f-b17e-c0f0f738cf3c","active":true},"submitted_by":{"user_status":"active","last_name":"Cao","date_created":"2018-04-02T07:00:00+00:00","@id":"/users/0588049b-24a4-44db-aff6-9110cd9a86b8/","lab":"/labs/curator/","@type":["user","item"],"affiliation":["10023"],"title":"Ye Cao","uuid":"0588049b-24a4-44db-aff6-9110cd9a86b8","first_name":"Ye","email":"ye.cao@bcm.edu"},"active":true,"number_individual":"","number_family":"","families":[],"uuid":"bc6d8cdd-9189-420e-9c8e-14093cd175fc","experimentalData":[],"number_experimental":""},{"modified_by":"/users/0588049b-24a4-44db-aff6-9110cd9a86b8/","@id":"/evidence/59237a4f-cf14-4b0f-b346-f54a083ad4d5/","affiliation":"10023","last_modified":"2019-09-27T13:11:09.573127+00:00","status":"in progress","date_created":"2018-05-02T03:55:18.944690+00:00","@type":["annotation","item"],"associatedGdm":["/gdm/ca78c869-d67c-40c8-8c70-fcc52a4d4744/"],"individuals":[],"groups":[],"schema_version":"4","number_group":"","article":{"schema_version":"1","@id":"/articles/21398687/","modified_by":"/users/0588049b-24a4-44db-aff6-9110cd9a86b8/","authors":["Gardie B","Remenieras A","Kattygnarath D","Bombled J","Lef\u00e8vre S","Perrier-Trudova V","Rustin P","Barrois M","Slama A","Avril MF","Bessis D","Caron O","Caux F","Collignon P","Coupier I","Cremin C","Dollfus H","Dugast C","Escudier B","Faivre L","Field M","Gilbert-Dussardier B","Janin N","Leport Y","Leroux D","Lipsker D","Malthieu F","McGilliwray B","Maugard C","M\u00e9jean A","Mortemousque I","Plessis G","Poppe B","Pruvost-Balland C","Rooker S","Roume J","Soufir N","Steinraths M","Tan MH","Th\u00e9odore C","Thomas L","Vabres P","Van Glabeke E","Meric JB","Verkarre V","Lenoir G","Joulin V","Deveaux S","Cusin V","Feunteun J","Teh BT","Bressac-de Paillerets B","Richard S","French National Cancer Institute \"Inherited predisposition to kidney cancer\" network"],"date_created":"2018-05-02T03:55:18.830918+00:00","@type":["article","item"],"journal":"Journal of medical genetics","doi":"","pmid":"21398687","submitted_by":{"user_status":"active","last_name":"Cao","date_created":"2018-04-02T07:00:00+00:00","@id":"/users/0588049b-24a4-44db-aff6-9110cd9a86b8/","lab":"/labs/curator/","@type":["user","item"],"affiliation":["10023"],"title":"Ye Cao","uuid":"0588049b-24a4-44db-aff6-9110cd9a86b8","first_name":"Ye","email":"ye.cao@bcm.edu"},"pmcid":"","last_modified":"2018-05-02T03:55:18.831283+00:00","abstract":"Hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell cancer (HLRCC) is an autosomal dominant disorder predisposing humans to cutaneous and uterine leiomyomas; in 20% of affected families, type 2 papillary renal cell cancers (PRCCII) also occur with aggressive course and poor prognosis.
