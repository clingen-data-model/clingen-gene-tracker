cardiomyopathy characterized by ventricular arrhythmias and sudden death. Currently 60% of patients meeting Task Force Criteria (TFC) have an identifiable mutation in one of the desmosomal genes. As much overlap is described between other cardiomyopathies and ARVC, we examined the prevalence of rare, possibly pathogenic sarcomere variants in the ARVC population.","@type":["article","item"],"doi":"","schema_version":"1","date":"2018 Jul;29(7):1004-1009.","active":true,"modified_by":"/users/c8035649-7e03-4eb0-8538-c7973a503663/","pmcid":""},"associatedGdm":["/gdm/bab4804f-b258-4f21-85ea-1d0a355e9725/"],"experimentalData":[],"last_modified":"2019-03-06T13:42:00.746298+00:00","number_experimental":""}],"last_modified":"2019-03-06T13:42:51.609748+00:00","draftClassification":"","modeInheritance":"Autosomal dominant inheritance (HP:0000006)","date_created":"2019-03-06T13:41:39.705344+00:00","disease":{"submitted_by":"/users/2a1dcf80-beb1-4b1e-9478-cf7f4904911b/","description":"Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) is a heart muscle disease that consists in progressive dystrophy of primarily the right ventricular myocardium with fibro-fatty replacement and ventricular dilation, and that is clinically characterized by ventricular arrhythmias and a risk of sudden cardiac death.","synonyms":["ARVC","ARVD","Right Ventricular Dysplasia","Arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia","arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia/cardiomyopathy","Arrhythmogenic RVD","arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia","ARVC cardiomyopathy"],"date_created":"2017-06-16T01:03:16.788266+00:00","associatedIndividuals":["/individuals/c76c9908-8633-4174-ae6f-7715050bab3c/","/individuals/dae16aac-d9df-4922-9322-338f54e2748b/","/individuals/6f098a98-87a5-47d4-a096-ed69c25bb028/","/individuals/0c73036c-aa23-471e-8631-30fae432119a/","/individuals/6a876751-f696-4dc0-9a66-d902301082bc/","/individuals/e5351cb1-7e1d-4bec-9c6b-e1fc1035f4ef/","/individuals/e6de7b74-8cd0-4288-ad8b-2bf4624055c3/","/individuals/19a11c03-66cb-4687-9ce0-a883946c61c5/","/individuals/7f2c49a6-20d5-4aaa-b0e1-788041a7d5b1/","/individuals/aa46800a-7b91-45ab-a3da-38cbba0d817d/"],"@id":"/diseases/cd1c30fe-1089-4821-9fb1-1b630e828d99/","status":"in progress","associatedInterpretations":["/interpretations/06a33c34-2d3d-4862-99c5-f81933dda3cf/","/interpretations/31b4ed40-d533-4f17-b0f5-2fb5470452f6/"],"associatedGroups":["/groups/a2de4577-fc8d-4185-b335-8bf5eda0782f/","/groups/a1b2121b-8c0c-46d3-8d07-5b54c51f0d1c/","/groups/c3fc341e-fd3d-448d-bda2-daa4d52de451/","/groups/59cae23d-6bb1-488c-b27a-cd53e4c2969c/","/groups/2af2f04f-1eb3-4284-bcdf-ebeb7594ab9e/","/groups/4c715a58-eab4-4823-aef2-0c0ed4fb8af5/","/groups/02a2f38f-7cbe-45b7-a6e5-2946fe7f7eeb/","/groups/9cb97362-3775-4c45-ab6c-1b1293623e83/","/groups/95ed099b-33b7-4501-8a6c-198c564aa8a5/","/groups/2a91d55c-1965-4266-8038-71fd6558667f/"],"associatedFamilies":["/families/55a55714-bab1-469d-852d-0fb37cede197/","/families/8b8861f7-b72c-4d0f-9191-30724d127ddb/","/families/572f864f-062c-4567-a5f4-29da77b0f327/","/families/9964a5d6-b5b1-40e4-b8aa-6fae77ef2ac8/","/families/e8903c10-53de-4e9b-81b0-d178fc85dac7/","/families/5bf5449f-9b4a-47f3-9266-e6fb089550d0/","/families/fd361567-cf74-4715-a9f6-44782ebe2ca7/","/families/af04519f-af9e-49ec-a290-0af3cd85e87c/","/families/222382ad-9289-4b66-b8c1-a945d8b6d644/"],"@type":["disease","item"],"schema_version":"2","last_modified":"2017-06-16T01:03:16.788277+00:00","uuid":"cd1c30fe-1089-4821-9fb1-1b630e828d99","modified_by":"/users/ac57e92b-f144-4b03-9d34-5c24b317e155/","term":"arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy","diseaseId":"MONDO_0016587","phenotypes":[],"associatedGdm":["/gdm/36a5a7df-f731-40bd-852f-19d24979a93e/","/gdm/8200c2b7-d0fe-4ed5-bb2a-ab5f28566a27/","/gdm/56045ff4-256d-437a-884f-34e077a57a85/","/gdm/da443dd4-1d44-4b7c-b3cb-6481af9cbcae/","/gdm/bab4804f-b258-4f21-85ea-1d0a355e9725/","/gdm/b34ded29-f1d5-4cca-a84a-0140b2460ef7/","/gdm/ee712c5b-a440-4ab3-b79a-42dd73e80d73/","/gdm/316ac2fc-555e-4c2e-a0ba-29a7e1663f72/","/gdm/2b9da339-e294-42d3-a0a7-caf0aef101a1/","/gdm/a50f2232-856e-4fa4-b023-22ab5649e974/"]},"number_provisional":"1","@id":"/gdm/bab4804f-b258-4f21-85ea-1d0a355e9725/","status":"in progress","number_article":"1","omimId":"","@type":["gdm","item"],"modeCode":"0","active":true,"modeInheritanceAdjective":"","audit":{},"finalClassification":"","modified_by":"/users/ea3554bc-c514-4ddb-b9d0-dcf04cfe9f34/"}},"associatedSnapshot":"/snapshots/5403748c-a38d-44b6-9bd5-b366aba2ecc5/","@type":["snapshot","item"],"schema_version":"2","approvalStatus":"Approved","modified_by":"/users/de63cd49-ce44-4514-8222-91145761f157/","resource":{"submitted_by":"/users/de63cd49-ce44-4514-8222-91145761f157/","uuid":"8e69d885-a5c6-48de-bb65-0943a6c2268d","publishSubmitter":"Courtney Thaxton","evidenceSummary":"There is no evidence that TMP1 is involved in ARVC.
