Although it is considered a desmosomal disease, mutations in non-desmosomal genes have also been identified. We report on a family where a mutation in LDB3 is associated with this condition. The index case and first and second degree relatives underwent a complete clinical evaluation: physical examination, electrocardiography (ECG), signal-averaged ECG, 2D echocardiogram, cardiac magnetic resonance and 24-h monitoring. After ruling out mutations in the five desmosomal genes, genetic testing by means of Next Generation Sequencing was carried out on the proband. A heterozygous missense mutation in LDB3 c.1051A>G was identified. This result was confirmed by subsequent Sanger DNA sequencing. Another six carriers were identified amongst her relatives. Three subjects fulfilled the criteria for a definitive diagnosis of ARVC and one reached a borderline diagnosis. In conclusion, this is the first family with ARVC where a mutation in LDB3 is associated with ARVC. Next generation sequencing arises as a particular useful tool to point to new causative genes in ARVC.

association of LDB3 with ARVC is disputed. \nA study (25041374) investigated a family affected by ARVC on which  Sanger sequencing failed to find a disease\u2010causing mutation in any of the five desmosomal genes in the proband (DSP, JUP, DSC2, DSG2, PKP2). The authors performed Next Generation Sequencing by using a 134 genes panel in order to discover a candidate disease\u2010causing gene. Genetic screening identified a missense variant on LDB3 causing the aminoacid substitution Thr351Ala, this variant was reported in ClinVar as conflicting interpretation (VUS, LB). This variant shows a high MAF in the general population to be associated with the disease even though the proband and family carriers do have ARVC.\nThere is disputed evidence that the identified LDB3 variant contribute to the ARVC phenotype and there is no known disease mechanism that would link LDB3 with ARVC.","active":true,"provisionalDate":"2020-02-04T03:38:29.498Z","sopVersion":"7","last_modified":"2020-05-08T14:06:27.580+00:00","uuid":"8ebdc3e8-2e0a-4a5e-8906-8e616d14008b","schema_version":"11","approvalReviewDate":"2019-09-12T16:00:00.000Z","publishClassification":true,"classificationStatus":"Approved","modified_by":"/users/de63cd49-ce44-4514-8222-91145761f157/","approvedClassification":true,"approvalSubmitter":"Courtney Thaxton","submitted_by":"/users/de63cd49-ce44-4514-8222-91145761f157/","reasons":"Only a single variant was found, and the MAF of that variant was above the ARVC EP cut-off.","approvalDate":"2020-05-08T14:06:01.465Z","@id":"/provisional/8ebdc3e8-2e0a-4a5e-8906-8e616d14008b/","classificationDate":"2020-02-04T03:38:16.872Z","classificationApprover":"Cindy James","publishAffiliation":"40003","@type":["provisionalClassification","item"],"autoClassification":"Limited","alteredClassification":"Disputed","contradictingEvidence":{"proband":false,"caseControl":false,"experimental":false},"publishDate":"2020-05-08T14:06:27.580Z","replicatedOverTime":false,"provisionalSubmitter":"Courtney Thaxton","publishSubmitter":"Courtney Thaxton","affiliation":"10003","date_created":"2018-06-08T08:45:05.988981+00:00","provisionalReviewDate":"2019-09-12T16:00:00.000Z","gdm_associated":["/gdm/34c00335-23f0-4822-b934-5f3ea4e63fb3/"],"classificationContributors":[],"additionalApprover":"","classificationPoints":{"geneticEvidenceTotal":0.1,"experimentalEvidenceTotal":0,"autosomalDominantOrXlinkedDisorder":{"probandWithPredictedOrProvenNullVariant":{"evidenceCount":0,"pointsCounted":0,"totalPointsGiven":0},"variantIsDeNovo":{"evidenceCount":0,"pointsCounted":0,"totalPointsGiven":0},"probandWithOtherVariantTypeWithGeneImpact":{"evidenceCount":1,"pointsCounted":0.1,"totalPointsGiven":0.1}},"functionalAlteration":{"patientCells":{"evidenceCount":0,"totalPointsGiven":0},"totalPointsGiven":0,"pointsCounted":0,"nonPatientCells":{"evidenceCount":0,"totalPointsGiven":0}},"autosomalRecessiveDisorder":{"twoVariantsInTransWithOneDeNovo":{"evidenceCount":0,"totalPointsGiven":0},"twoVariantsWithGeneImpactInTrans":{"evidenceCount":0,"totalPointsGiven":0},"pointsCounted":0},"segregation":{"evidenceCountTotal":0,"evidenceCountExome":0,"evidencePointsExome":0,"pointsCounted":0,"evidencePointsCandidate":0,"totalPointsGiven":0,"evidenceCountCandidate":0},"modelsRescue":{"rescueNonHuman":{"evidenceCount":0,"totalPointsGiven":0},"modelsCellCulture":{"evidenceCount":0,"totalPointsGiven":0},"pointsCounted":0,"rescueHuman":{"evidenceCount":0,"totalPointsGiven":0},"rescuePatientCells":{"evidenceCount":0,"totalPointsGiven":0},"modelsNonHuman":{"evidenceCount":0,"totalPointsGiven":0},"totalPointsGiven":0,"rescueCellCulture":{"evidenceCount":0,"totalPointsGiven":0}},"function":{"biochemicalFunctions":{"evidenceCount":0,"totalPointsGiven":0},"expression":{"evidenceCount":0,"totalPointsGiven":0},"totalPointsGiven":0,"pointsCounted":0,"proteinInteractions":{"evidenceCount":0,"totalPointsGiven":0}},"caseControl":{"evidenceCount":0,"pointsCounted":0,"totalPointsGiven":0},"evidencePointsTotal":0.1}},"last_modified":"2020-05-08T14:06:28.116565+00:00","modified_by":"/users/de63cd49-ce44-4514-8222-91145761f157/","approvalStatus":"Approved","submitted_by":"/users/de63cd49-ce44-4514-8222-91145761f157/","date_created":"2020-05-08T14:06:03.656450+00:00","@type":["snapshot","item"],"associatedSnapshot":"/snapshots/07e569b4-3453-4bbe-93af-f3a30c454ed1/"}
