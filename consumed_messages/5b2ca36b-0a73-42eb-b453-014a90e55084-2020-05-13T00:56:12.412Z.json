Variants in PCSK9 were first reported in humans with this disease as early as 2003 (Abifadel et al., PMID: 12730697). At least 15 variants (missense) have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data, segregation data, and experimental data. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 17 probands in 6 publications (PMIDs: 12730697, 15772090, 22683120, 26541928, 29127338, 20006333). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in at least 31 family members. The mechanism for disease is heterozygous gain of function (Maxwell et al., 2005; PMID: 16577715), while heterozygous loss of function variants are associated with low levels of LDL cholesterol (Cohen et al., 2005, PMID: 15654334). This gene-disease association is supported by animal models, expression studies, and in vitro functional assays. In summary, PCSK9 is definitively associated with autosomal dominant familial hypercholesterolemia. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.","approvalDate":"2020-05-13T00:55:59.641Z","approvalSubmitter":"Courtney Thaxton"},"date_created":"2020-05-13T00:55:58.253188+00:00","@type":["snapshot","item"],"resourceParent":{"gdm":{"gdm_title":"PCSK9-99159b7d-2f8f-40c3-8a78-aac16c8fbdd3-0","variantPathogenicity":[{"assessments":[],"@id":"/pathogenicity/fce028ac-c439-4d44-b7d0-f16ab5fe382a/","modified_by":"/users/c0a70214-08a8-48a0-ba8d-521bed321d4a/","denovoType":"","date_created":"2017-08-21T20:29:15.771728+00:00","numberOfAssessment":"","supportingSegregation":true,"@type":["pathogenicity","item"],"associatedGdm":["/gdm/fdd3ee83-07d1-42f4-88d9-81874a6369fc/"],"variant":{"associatedInterpretations":[],"variationType":"single nucleotide variant","clinVarSCVs":[],"clinvarVariantId":"2873","molecularConsequenceList":[{"soId":"SO:0001583","term":"missense variant","hgvsName":"NM_174936.3:c.381T>A"},{"soId":"SO:0001627","term":"intron variant","hgvsName":"NR_110451.1:n.182+3613T>A"}],"@id":"/variants/abe3b9a0-da64-4586-a219-664745c16925/","schema_version":"6","associatedPathogenicities":["/pathogenicity/fce028ac-c439-4d44-b7d0-f16ab5fe382a/"],"last_modified":"2017-08-21T20:27:38.675323+00:00","uuid":"abe3b9a0-da64-4586-a219-664745c16925","carId":"","dbSNPIds":["28942111"],"date_created":"2017-08-21T20:27:38.675312+00:00","clinVarRCVs":[],"@type":["variant","item"],"otherDescription":"","molecular_consequence":"missense variant","variation_type":"single nucleotide variant","status":"in progress","variant_identifier":"2873","submitted_by":{"@id":"/users/84a6e93b-5075-4dfb-9de5-a9fcde89abc9/","last_name":"McGlaughon","date_created":"2017-01-05T08:00:00+00:00","affiliation":["10003","10008","10009","10010","10011","10023","10026","10049"],"lab":"/labs/curator/","@type":["user","item"],"email":"jennifer.mcglaughon@gmail.com","title":"Jen McGlaughon","uuid":"84a6e93b-5075-4dfb-9de5-a9fcde89abc9","first_name":"Jen","user_status":"active"},"maneTranscriptTitle":"","hgvsNames":{"others":["NG_009061.1:g.9470T>A","NM_174936.3:c.381T>A","NP_777596.2:p.Ser127Arg","NR_110451.1:n.182+3613T>A","Q8NBP7:p.Ser127Arg","LRG_275p1:p.Ser127Arg","LRG_275:g.9470T>A","LRG_275t1:c.381T>A"],"GRCh38":"NC_000001.11:g.55044016T>A","GRCh37":"NC_000001.10:g.55509689T>A"},"clinvarVariantTitle":"NM_174936.3(PCSK9):c.381T>A (p.Ser127Arg)","source":"ClinVar"},"schema_version":"2","comment":"From ClinVar (OMIM): In 2 French families with autosomal dominant hypercholesterolemia (603776), Abifadel et al.

hypercholesterolemia (ADH; OMIM144400), a risk factor for coronary heart disease, is characterized by an increase in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels that is associated with mutations in the genes LDLR (encoding low-density lipoprotein receptor) or APOB (encoding apolipoprotein B).

hypercholesterolemia (ADH; OMIM144400), a risk factor for coronary heart disease, is characterized by an increase in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels that is associated with mutations in the genes LDLR (encoding low-density lipoprotein receptor) or APOB (encoding apolipoprotein B). We mapped a third locus associated with ADH, HCHOLA3 at 1p32, and now report two mutations in the gene PCSK9 (encoding proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9) that cause ADH. PCSK9 encodes NARC-1 (neural apoptosis regulated convertase), a newly identified human subtilase that is highly expressed in the liver and contributes to cholesterol homeostasis.","date":"2003 Jun;34(2):154-6.","title":"Mutations in PCSK9 cause autosomal dominant hypercholesterolemia.","uuid":"849654dc-e71b-4e57-8efd-e2317db3bf78","active":true},"submitted_by":"/users/84a6e93b-5075-4dfb-9de5-a9fcde89abc9/","active":true,"number_individual":1,"number_family":1,"affiliation":"10026","families":["/families/67912bcc-a1b6-4d17-a9e5-7f86d2071e92/"],"uuid":"b6b2d72f-fe7f-4a4f-b61c-de68de36c56b","experimentalData":[],"number_experimental":""}],"associatedGroups":[],"schema_version":"7","hpoIdInDiagnosis":["HP:0003124"],"last_modified":"2020-04-29T04:22:00.379621+00:00","uuid":"67912bcc-a1b6-4d17-a9e5-7f86d2071e92","countryOfOrigin":"France","method":{"previousTesting":true,"additionalInformation":"","entireGeneSequenced":true,"specificMutationsGenotypedMethod":"29 family members tested using parametric linkage analysis.

hypercholesterolemia (ADH; OMIM144400), a risk factor for coronary heart disease, is characterized by an increase in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels that is associated with mutations in the genes LDLR (encoding low-density lipoprotein receptor) or APOB (encoding apolipoprotein B). We mapped a third locus associated with ADH, HCHOLA3 at 1p32, and now report two mutations in the gene PCSK9 (encoding proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9) that cause ADH. PCSK9 encodes NARC-1 (neural apoptosis regulated convertase), a newly identified human subtilase that is highly expressed in the liver and contributes to cholesterol homeostasis.","date":"2003 Jun;34(2):154-6.","title":"Mutations in PCSK9 cause autosomal dominant hypercholesterolemia.","uuid":"849654dc-e71b-4e57-8efd-e2317db3bf78","active":true},"submitted_by":"/users/84a6e93b-5075-4dfb-9de5-a9fcde89abc9/","active":true,"number_individual":1,"number_family":1,"affiliation":"10026","families":["/families/67912bcc-a1b6-4d17-a9e5-7f86d2071e92/"],"uuid":"b6b2d72f-fe7f-4a4f-b61c-de68de36c56b","experimentalData":[],"number_experimental":""}],"associatedGroups":[],"schema_version":"7","hpoIdInDiagnosis":["HP:0003124"],"last_modified":"2020-04-29T04:22:00.379621+00:00","uuid":"67912bcc-a1b6-4d17-a9e5-7f86d2071e92","countryOfOrigin":"France","method":{"previousTesting":true,"additionalInformation":"","entireGeneSequenced":true,"specificMutationsGenotypedMethod":"29 family members tested using parametric linkage analysis.

The 2 individuals also showed a decrease in VLDL and IDL conversion (10 to 30% of controls), and their LDL fractional catabolic rate was slightly decreased (by 30%) compared with

ClinVar (OMIM): In 2 French families with autosomal dominant hypercholesterolemia (603776), Abifadel et al.

The 2 individuals also showed a decrease in VLDL and IDL conversion (10 to 30% of controls), and their LDL fractional catabolic rate was slightly decreased (by 30%) compared with controls.","supportingExperimental":true,"last_modified":"2020-04-29T04:22:01.176592+00:00","affiliation":"10026","submitted_by":{"@id":"/users/84a6e93b-5075-4dfb-9de5-a9fcde89abc9/","last_name":"McGlaughon","date_created":"2017-01-05T08:00:00+00:00","affiliation":["10003","10008","10009","10010","10011","10023","10026","10049"],"lab":"/labs/curator/","@type":["user","item"],"email":"jennifer.mcglaughon@gmail.com","title":"Jen McGlaughon","uuid":"84a6e93b-5075-4dfb-9de5-a9fcde89abc9","first_name":"Jen","user_status":"active"},"uuid":"fce028ac-c439-4d44-b7d0-f16ab5fe382a","geneImpactType":"non-lof"}],"last_modified":"2017-08-21T20:27:38.675323+00:00","uuid":"abe3b9a0-da64-4586-a219-664745c16925","carId":"","dbSNPIds":["28942111"],"date_created":"2017-08-21T20:27:38.675312+00:00","clinVarRCVs":[],"@type":["variant","item"],"otherDescription":"","molecular_consequence":"missense variant","variation_type":"single nucleotide variant","status":"in progress","variant_identifier":"2873","submitted_by":{"@id":"/users/84a6e93b-5075-4dfb-9de5-a9fcde89abc9/","last_name":"McGlaughon","date_created":"2017-01-05T08:00:00+00:00","affiliation":["10003","10008","10009","10010","10011","10023","10026","10049"],"lab":"/labs/curator/","@type":["user","item"],"email":"jennifer.mcglaughon@gmail.com","title":"Jen McGlaughon","uuid":"84a6e93b-5075-4dfb-9de5-a9fcde89abc9","first_name":"Jen","user_status":"active"},"maneTranscriptTitle":"","hgvsNames":{"others":["NG_009061.1:g.9470T>A","NM_174936.3:c.381T>A","NP_777596.2:p.Ser127Arg","NR_110451.1:n.182+3613T>A","Q8NBP7:p.Ser127Arg","LRG_275p1:p.Ser127Arg","LRG_275:g.9470T>A","LRG_275t1:c.381T>A"],"GRCh38":"NC_000001.11:g.55044016T>A","GRCh37":"NC_000001.10:g.55509689T>A"},"clinvarVariantTitle":"NM_174936.3(PCSK9):c.381T>A (p.Ser127Arg)","source":"ClinVar"}]},"submitted_by":{"@id":"/users/84a6e93b-5075-4dfb-9de5-a9fcde89abc9/","last_name":"McGlaughon","date_created":"2017-01-05T08:00:00+00:00","affiliation":["10003","10008","10009","10010","10011","10023","10026","10049"],"lab":"/labs/curator/","@type":["user","item"],"email":"jennifer.mcglaughon@gmail.com","title":"Jen McGlaughon","uuid":"84a6e93b-5075-4dfb-9de5-a9fcde89abc9","first_name":"Jen","user_status":"active"},"otherPMIDs":[],"active":true}],"uuid":"b6b2d72f-fe7f-4a4f-b61c-de68de36c56b","experimentalData":[],"number_experimental":""},{"number_group":"","@id":"/evidence/23159adb-7f0e-4d9b-ab77-af3beefd3055/","modified_by":"/users/c0a70214-08a8-48a0-ba8d-521bed321d4a/","last_modified":"2020-04-29T04:22:00.457942+00:00","status":"in progress","date_created":"2017-08-22T19:52:52.189823+00:00","@type":["annotation","item"],"associatedGdm":["/gdm/fdd3ee83-07d1-42f4-88d9-81874a6369fc/"],"individuals":[],"groups":[],"schema_version":"4","article":{"schema_version":"1","@id":"/articles/12552133/","authors":["Seidah NG","Benjannet S","Wickham L","Marcinkiewicz J","Jasmin SB","Stifani S","Basak A","Prat A","Chretien M"],"date_created":"2017-08-22T19:52:51.950352+00:00","@type":["article","item"],"journal":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","doi":"","pmid":"12552133","submitted_by":{"@id":"/users/84a6e93b-5075-4dfb-9de5-a9fcde89abc9/","last_name":"McGlaughon","date_created":"2017-01-05T08:00:00+00:00","affiliation":["10003","10008","10009","10010","10011","10023","10026","10049"],"lab":"/labs/curator/","@type":["user","item"],"email":"jennifer.mcglaughon@gmail.com","title":"Jen McGlaughon","uuid":"84a6e93b-5075-4dfb-9de5-a9fcde89abc9","first_name":"Jen","user_status":"active"},"pmcid":"","last_modified":"2017-08-22T19:52:51.950365+00:00","abstract":"Seven secretory mammalian kexin-like subtilases have been identified that cleave a variety of precursor proteins at monobasic and dibasic residues. The recently characterized pyrolysin-like subtilase SKI-1 cleaves proproteins at nonbasic residues. In this work we describe the properties of a proteinase K-like subtilase, neural apoptosis-regulated convertase 1 (NARC-1), representing the ninth member of the secretory subtilase family. Biosynthetic and microsequencing analyses of WT and mutant enzyme revealed that human and mouse pro-NARC-1 are autocatalytically and intramolecularly processed into NARC-1 at the (Y,I)VV(V,L)(L,M) downward arrow motif, a site that is representative of its enzymic specificity. In vitro peptide processing studies andor Ala substitutions of the P1-P5 sites suggested that hydrophobicaliphatic residues are more critical at P1, P3, and P5 than at P2 or P4. NARC-1 expression is highest in neuroepithelioma SK-N-MCIXC, hepatic BRL-3A, and in colon carcinoma LoVo-C5 cell lines. In situ hybridization and Northern blot analyses of NARC-1 expression during development in the adult and after partial hepatectomy revealed that it is expressed in cells that have the capacity to proliferate and differentiate. These include hepatocytes, kidney mesenchymal cells, intestinal ileum, and colon epithelia as well as embryonic brain telencephalon neurons. Accordingly, transfection of NARC-1 in primary cultures of embryonic day 13.5 telencephalon cells led to enhanced recruitment of undifferentiated neural progenitor cells into the neuronal lineage, suggesting that NARC-1 is implicated in the differentiation of cortical neurons.","date":"2003 Feb 04;100(3):928-33.","title":"The secretory proprotein convertase neural apoptosis-regulated convertase

kexin-like subtilases have been identified that cleave a variety of precursor proteins at monobasic and dibasic residues. The recently characterized pyrolysin-like subtilase SKI-1 cleaves proproteins at nonbasic residues. In this work we describe the properties of a proteinase K-like subtilase, neural apoptosis-regulated convertase 1 (NARC-1), representing the ninth member of the secretory subtilase family. Biosynthetic and microsequencing analyses of WT and mutant enzyme revealed that human and mouse pro-NARC-1 are autocatalytically and intramolecularly processed into NARC-1 at the (Y,I)VV(V,L)(L,M) downward arrow motif, a site that is representative of its enzymic specificity. In vitro peptide processing studies andor Ala substitutions of the P1-P5 sites suggested that hydrophobicaliphatic residues are more critical at P1, P3, and P5 than at P2 or P4. NARC-1 expression is highest in neuroepithelioma SK-N-MCIXC, hepatic BRL-3A, and in colon carcinoma LoVo-C5 cell lines. In situ hybridization and Northern blot analyses of NARC-1 expression during development in the adult and after partial hepatectomy revealed that it is expressed in cells that have the capacity to proliferate and differentiate. These include hepatocytes, kidney mesenchymal cells, intestinal ileum, and colon epithelia as well as embryonic brain telencephalon neurons. Accordingly, transfection of NARC-1 in primary cultures of embryonic day 13.5 telencephalon cells led to enhanced recruitment of undifferentiated neural progenitor cells into the neuronal lineage, suggesting that NARC-1 is implicated in the differentiation of cortical neurons.","date":"2003 Feb 04;100(3):928-33.","title":"The secretory proprotein convertase neural apoptosis-regulated convertase

subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) is a member of the proteinase K subfamily of subtilases that reduces the number of LDL receptors (LDLRs) in liver through an undefined posttranscriptional mechanism. We show that purified PCSK9 added to the medium of HepG2 cells reduces the number of cell-surface LDLRs in a dose- and time-dependent manner. This activity was approximately 10-fold greater for a gain-of-function mutant, PCSK9(D374Y), that causes hypercholesterolemia. Binding and uptake of PCSK9 were largely dependent on the presence of LDLRs. Coimmunoprecipitation and ligand blotting studies indicated that PCSK9 and LDLR directly associate; both proteins colocalized to late endocytic compartments. Purified PCSK9 had no effect on cell-surface LDLRs in hepatocytes lacking autosomal recessive hypercholesterolemia (ARH), an adaptor protein required for endocytosis of the receptor. Transgenic mice overexpressing human PCSK9 in liver secreted large amounts of the protein into plasma, which increased plasma LDL cholesterol concentrations to levels similar to those of LDLR-knockout mice. To determine whether PCSK9 was active in plasma, transgenic PCSK9 mice were parabiosed with wild-type littermates. After parabiosis, secreted PCSK9 was transferred to the circulation of wild-type mice and reduced the number of hepatic LDLRs to nearly undetectable levels. We conclude that secreted PCSK9 associates with the LDLR and reduces hepatic LDLR protein levels.","date":"2006 Nov;116(11):2995-3005.","title":"Secreted PCSK9 decreases the number of LDL receptors in

subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) is a member of the proteinase K subfamily of subtilases that reduces the number of LDL receptors (LDLRs) in liver through an undefined posttranscriptional mechanism. We show that purified PCSK9 added to the medium of HepG2 cells reduces the number of cell-surface LDLRs in a dose- and time-dependent manner. This activity was approximately 10-fold greater for a gain-of-function mutant, PCSK9(D374Y), that causes hypercholesterolemia. Binding and uptake of PCSK9 were largely dependent on the presence of LDLRs. Coimmunoprecipitation and ligand blotting studies indicated that PCSK9 and LDLR directly associate; both proteins colocalized to late endocytic compartments. Purified PCSK9 had no effect on cell-surface LDLRs in hepatocytes lacking autosomal recessive hypercholesterolemia (ARH), an adaptor protein required for endocytosis of the receptor. Transgenic mice overexpressing human PCSK9 in liver secreted large amounts of the protein into plasma, which increased plasma LDL cholesterol concentrations to levels similar to those of LDLR-knockout mice. To determine whether PCSK9 was active in plasma, transgenic PCSK9 mice were parabiosed with wild-type littermates. After parabiosis, secreted PCSK9 was transferred to the circulation of wild-type mice and reduced the number of hepatic LDLRs to nearly undetectable levels. We conclude that secreted PCSK9 associates with the LDLR and reduces hepatic LDLR protein levels.","date":"2006 Nov;116(11):2995-3005.","title":"Secreted PCSK9 decreases the number of LDL receptors in hepatocytes and in livers of parabiotic mice.","uuid":"4e699f72-395a-45c4-ab76-7dfe8924e0bc","active":true},"submitted_by":"/users/84a6e93b-5075-4dfb-9de5-a9fcde89abc9/","active":true,"number_individual":"","number_family":"","affiliation":"10026","families":[],"uuid":"efb856db-2fc7-44b2-b7a5-20edf3ba23d4","experimentalData":["/experimental/31b2417f-b6b5-400f-b757-d9a14b0f193c/"],"number_experimental":1}],"functionalAlteration":{},"schema_version":"8","expression":{"organOfTissue":[],"normalExpression":{},"alteredExpression":{}},"proteinInteractions":{"relationshipOfOtherGenesToDisese":"CO-IP with wild type or mutant (D374Y) PCSK9 and LDLR were carried out in HepG2 cells.

dominant familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH) is caused by mutations in the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor or apolipoprotein B genes that result in defective clearance of plasma LDL by the liver, but a third gene (PCSK9), encoding a putative proprotein convertase, has recently been implicated. Two independent microarray studies support a role for PCSK9 in sterol metabolism and adenoviral-mediated over-expression of PCSK9 in mouse liver depletes hepatic LDL-receptor protein, but the mechanism by which dominant mutations cause human FH is unclear. We have identified the D374Y mutant of PCSK9 in three FH families of English origin; all 12 affected individuals have unusually severe hypercholesterolaemia and require more stringent treatment than typical FH patients, who are heterozygous for defects in the LDL receptor. We have stably expressed wild-type (WT) and variant PCSK9 in McArdle-7777 rat hepatoma cells and shown by confocal microscopy that all forms of PCSK9 co-localize with protein disulphide isomerase in the ER whether or not they can be autocleaved. Expression of the proposed pathogenic variants, but not of WT, S386A or F216L PCSK9, increases secretion of apolipoprotein B100-containing lipoproteins from the cells by 2-4-fold probably by reducing the degradation of nascent protein; no differences in LDL-receptor content were observed in cells expressing WT, S386A or F216L PCSK9 and only a small reduction in cells expressing the D374Y or S127R mutants.

dominant familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH) is caused by mutations in the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor or apolipoprotein B genes that result in defective clearance of plasma LDL by the liver, but a third gene (PCSK9), encoding a putative proprotein convertase, has recently been implicated. Two independent microarray studies support a role for PCSK9 in sterol metabolism and adenoviral-mediated over-expression of PCSK9 in mouse liver depletes hepatic LDL-receptor protein, but the mechanism by which dominant mutations cause human FH is unclear. We have identified the D374Y mutant of PCSK9 in three FH families of English origin; all 12 affected individuals have unusually severe hypercholesterolaemia and require more stringent treatment than typical FH patients, who are heterozygous for defects in the LDL receptor. We have stably expressed wild-type (WT) and variant PCSK9 in McArdle-7777 rat hepatoma cells and shown by confocal microscopy that all forms of PCSK9 co-localize with protein disulphide isomerase in the ER whether or not they can be autocleaved. Expression of the proposed pathogenic variants, but not of WT, S386A or F216L PCSK9, increases secretion of apolipoprotein B100-containing lipoproteins from the cells by 2-4-fold probably by reducing the degradation of nascent protein; no differences in LDL-receptor content were observed in cells expressing WT, S386A or F216L PCSK9 and only a small reduction in cells expressing the D374Y or S127R mutants. This suggests that the variants of PCSK9 found in FH influence the secretion of apoB-containing lipoproteins, providing an explanation for the marked increase in circulating LDL in heterozygous carriers.","date":"2005 May 01;14(9):1161-9.","title":"Evidence for effect of mutant PCSK9 on apolipoprotein B secretion as the cause of unusually severe dominant

dominant familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH) is caused by mutations in the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor or apolipoprotein B genes that result in defective clearance of plasma LDL by the liver, but a third gene (PCSK9), encoding a putative proprotein convertase, has recently been implicated. Two independent microarray studies support a role for PCSK9 in sterol metabolism and adenoviral-mediated over-expression of PCSK9 in mouse liver depletes hepatic LDL-receptor protein, but the mechanism by which dominant mutations cause human FH is unclear. We have identified the D374Y mutant of PCSK9 in three FH families of English origin; all 12 affected individuals have unusually severe hypercholesterolaemia and require more stringent treatment than typical FH patients, who are heterozygous for defects in the LDL receptor. We have stably expressed wild-type (WT) and variant PCSK9 in McArdle-7777 rat hepatoma cells and shown by confocal microscopy that all forms of PCSK9 co-localize with protein disulphide isomerase in the ER whether or not they can be autocleaved. Expression of the proposed pathogenic variants, but not of WT, S386A or F216L PCSK9, increases secretion of apolipoprotein B100-containing lipoproteins from the cells by 2-4-fold probably by reducing the degradation of nascent protein; no differences in LDL-receptor content were observed in cells expressing WT, S386A or F216L PCSK9 and only a small reduction in cells expressing the D374Y or S127R mutants. This suggests that the variants of PCSK9 found in FH influence the secretion of apoB-containing lipoproteins, providing an explanation for the marked increase in circulating LDL in heterozygous carriers.","date":"2005 May 01;14(9):1161-9.","title":"Evidence for effect of mutant PCSK9 on apolipoprotein B secretion as the cause of unusually severe dominant

dominant familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH) is caused by mutations in the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor or apolipoprotein B genes that result in defective clearance of plasma LDL by the liver, but a third gene (PCSK9), encoding a putative proprotein convertase, has recently been implicated. Two independent microarray studies support a role for PCSK9 in sterol metabolism and adenoviral-mediated over-expression of PCSK9 in mouse liver depletes hepatic LDL-receptor protein, but the mechanism by which dominant mutations cause human FH is unclear. We have identified the D374Y mutant of PCSK9 in three FH families of English origin; all 12 affected individuals have unusually severe hypercholesterolaemia and require more stringent treatment than typical FH patients, who are heterozygous for defects in the LDL receptor. We have stably expressed wild-type (WT) and variant PCSK9 in McArdle-7777 rat hepatoma cells and shown by confocal microscopy that all forms of PCSK9 co-localize with protein disulphide isomerase in the ER whether or not they can be autocleaved. Expression of the proposed pathogenic variants, but not of WT, S386A or F216L PCSK9, increases secretion of apolipoprotein B100-containing lipoproteins from the cells by 2-4-fold probably by reducing the degradation of nascent protein; no differences in LDL-receptor content were observed in cells expressing WT, S386A or F216L PCSK9 and only a small reduction in cells expressing the D374Y or S127R mutants. This suggests that the variants of PCSK9 found in FH influence the secretion of apoB-containing lipoproteins, providing an explanation for the marked increase in circulating LDL in heterozygous carriers.","date":"2005 May 01;14(9):1161-9.","title":"Evidence for effect of mutant PCSK9 on apolipoprotein B secretion as the cause of unusually severe dominant

dominant familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH) is caused by mutations in the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor or apolipoprotein B genes that result in defective clearance of plasma LDL by the liver, but a third gene (PCSK9), encoding a putative proprotein convertase, has recently been implicated. Two independent microarray studies support a role for PCSK9 in sterol metabolism and adenoviral-mediated over-expression of PCSK9 in mouse liver depletes hepatic LDL-receptor protein, but the mechanism by which dominant mutations cause human FH is unclear. We have identified the D374Y mutant of PCSK9 in three FH families of English origin; all 12 affected individuals have unusually severe hypercholesterolaemia and require more stringent treatment than typical FH patients, who are heterozygous for defects in the LDL receptor. We have stably expressed wild-type (WT) and variant PCSK9 in McArdle-7777 rat hepatoma cells and shown by confocal microscopy that all forms of PCSK9 co-localize with protein disulphide isomerase in the ER whether or not they can be autocleaved. Expression of the proposed pathogenic variants, but not of WT, S386A or F216L PCSK9, increases secretion of apolipoprotein B100-containing lipoproteins from the cells by 2-4-fold probably by reducing the degradation of nascent protein; no differences in LDL-receptor content were observed in cells expressing WT, S386A or F216L PCSK9 and only a small reduction in cells expressing the D374Y or S127R mutants. This suggests that the variants of PCSK9 found in FH influence the secretion of apoB-containing lipoproteins, providing an explanation for the marked increase in circulating LDL in heterozygous carriers.","date":"2005 May 01;14(9):1161-9.","title":"Evidence for effect of mutant PCSK9 on apolipoprotein B secretion as the cause of unusually severe dominant

dominant familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH) is caused by mutations in the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor or apolipoprotein B genes that result in defective clearance of plasma LDL by the liver, but a third gene (PCSK9), encoding a putative proprotein convertase, has recently been implicated. Two independent microarray studies support a role for PCSK9 in sterol metabolism and adenoviral-mediated over-expression of PCSK9 in mouse liver depletes hepatic LDL-receptor protein, but the mechanism by which dominant mutations cause human FH is unclear. We have identified the D374Y mutant of PCSK9 in three FH families of English origin; all 12 affected individuals have unusually severe hypercholesterolaemia and require more stringent treatment than typical FH patients, who are heterozygous for defects in the LDL receptor. We have stably expressed wild-type (WT) and variant PCSK9 in McArdle-7777 rat hepatoma cells and shown by confocal microscopy that all forms of PCSK9 co-localize with protein disulphide isomerase in the ER whether or not they can be autocleaved. Expression of the proposed pathogenic variants, but not of WT, S386A or F216L PCSK9, increases secretion of apolipoprotein B100-containing lipoproteins from the cells by 2-4-fold probably by reducing the degradation of nascent protein; no differences in LDL-receptor content were observed in cells expressing WT, S386A or F216L PCSK9 and only a small reduction in cells expressing the D374Y or S127R mutants. This suggests that the variants of PCSK9 found in FH influence the secretion of apoB-containing lipoproteins, providing an explanation for the marked increase in circulating LDL in heterozygous carriers.","date":"2005 May 01;14(9):1161-9.","title":"Evidence for effect of mutant PCSK9 on apolipoprotein B secretion as the cause of unusually severe dominant

dominant familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH) is caused by mutations in the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor or apolipoprotein B genes that result in defective clearance of plasma LDL by the liver, but a third gene (PCSK9), encoding a putative proprotein convertase, has recently been implicated. Two independent microarray studies support a role for PCSK9 in sterol metabolism and adenoviral-mediated over-expression of PCSK9 in mouse liver depletes hepatic LDL-receptor protein, but the mechanism by which dominant mutations cause human FH is unclear. We have identified the D374Y mutant of PCSK9 in three FH families of English origin; all 12 affected individuals have unusually severe hypercholesterolaemia and require more stringent treatment than typical FH patients, who are heterozygous for defects in the LDL receptor. We have stably expressed wild-type (WT) and variant PCSK9 in McArdle-7777 rat hepatoma cells and shown by confocal microscopy that all forms of PCSK9 co-localize with protein disulphide isomerase in the ER whether or not they can be autocleaved. Expression of the proposed pathogenic variants, but not of WT, S386A or F216L PCSK9, increases secretion of apolipoprotein B100-containing lipoproteins from the cells by 2-4-fold probably by reducing the degradation of nascent protein; no differences in LDL-receptor content were observed in cells expressing WT, S386A or F216L PCSK9 and only a small reduction in cells expressing the D374Y or S127R mutants. This suggests that the variants of PCSK9 found in FH influence the secretion of apoB-containing lipoproteins, providing an explanation for the marked increase in circulating LDL in heterozygous carriers.","date":"2005 May 01;14(9):1161-9.","title":"Evidence for effect of mutant PCSK9 on apolipoprotein B secretion as the cause of unusually severe dominant

dominant familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH) is caused by mutations in the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor or apolipoprotein B genes that result in defective clearance of plasma LDL by the liver, but a third gene (PCSK9), encoding a putative proprotein convertase, has recently been implicated. Two independent microarray studies support a role for PCSK9 in sterol metabolism and adenoviral-mediated over-expression of PCSK9 in mouse liver depletes hepatic LDL-receptor protein, but the mechanism by which dominant mutations cause human FH is unclear. We have identified the D374Y mutant of PCSK9 in three FH families of English origin; all 12 affected individuals have unusually severe hypercholesterolaemia and require more stringent treatment than typical FH patients, who are heterozygous for defects in the LDL receptor. We have stably expressed wild-type (WT) and variant PCSK9 in McArdle-7777 rat hepatoma cells and shown by confocal microscopy that all forms of PCSK9 co-localize with protein disulphide isomerase in the ER whether or not they can be autocleaved. Expression of the proposed pathogenic variants, but not of WT, S386A or F216L PCSK9, increases secretion of apolipoprotein B100-containing lipoproteins from the cells by 2-4-fold probably by reducing the degradation of nascent protein; no differences in LDL-receptor content were observed in cells expressing WT, S386A or F216L PCSK9 and only a small reduction in cells expressing the D374Y or S127R mutants. This suggests that the variants of PCSK9 found in FH influence the secretion of apoB-containing lipoproteins, providing an explanation for the marked increase in circulating LDL in heterozygous carriers.","date":"2005 May 01;14(9):1161-9.","title":"Evidence for effect of mutant PCSK9 on apolipoprotein B secretion as the cause of unusually severe dominant

identification of mutations in PCSK9 (proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin9) in autosomal dominant hypercholesterolemia (ADH), has revealed the existence of a new player in cholesterol homeostasis. PCSK9 has been shown to enhance the degradation of the LDL receptor (LDLR) at the cell surface. Gain-of-function mutations of PCSK9 induce ADH and are very rare, but their identification is crucial in studying PCSK9's role in hypercholesterolemia, its detailed trafficking pathway and its impact

hypercholesterolemia (FH) is an autosomal dominant disease caused by pathogenic variants in genes encoding for LDL receptor (LDLR), Apolipoprotein B and Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9). Among PCSK9 variants, only Gain-of- Function (GOF) variants lead to FH. Greater attention should be paid to the classification of variants as pathogenic. Two hundred sixty nine patients with a clinical suspect of FH were screened for variants in LDLR and the patients without pathogenic variants were screened for variants in PCSK9 and APOB. Functional characterization of PCSK9 variants was performed by assessment of protein secretion, of LDLR activity in presence of PCSK9 variant proteins as well as of the LDLR affinity of the PCSK9 variants. Among 81 patients without pathogenic variants in LDLR, 7 PCSK9 heterozygotes were found, 4 of whom were carriers of variants whose role in FH pathogenesis is still unknown. Functional characterization revealed that two variants (p.(Ser636Arg) and p.(Arg357Cys)) were GOF variants. In Conclusions, we demonstrated a GOF effect of 2 PCSK9 variants that can be considered as FH-causative variants. The study highlights the important role played by functional characterization in integrating diagnostic procedures when the pathogenicity of new variants has not been previously demonstrated.","date":"2017 Nov 10;7(1):15282.","title":"Identification and in vitro characterization of two new PCSK9 Gain of Function variants found in patients with Familial Hypercholesterolemia.","uuid":"9b84f4cd-471c-491c-9fa6-2771983b4fcb","active":true},"submitted_by":"/users/84a6e93b-5075-4dfb-9de5-a9fcde89abc9/","active":true,"number_individual":"","number_family":"","affiliation":"10026","families":[],"uuid":"4e356d0b-e689-4651-95c5-392ddaa4bfa3","experimentalData":[],"number_experimental":""}],"familyIncluded":[],"schema_version":"6","hpoIdInDiagnosis":["HP:0003124"],"last_modified":"2020-04-29T04:22:00.810485+00:00","hpoIdInElimination":[],"otherGenes":[{"@id":"/genes/LDLR/","omimIds":["606945"],"previousNames":[],"hgncStatus":"Approved","@type":["gene","item"],"locusType":"gene with protein product","chromosome":"19p13.2","pmids":[],"previousSymbols":[],"schema_version":"1","entrezId":"3949","synonyms":["LDLCQ2"],"symbol":"LDLR","status":"current","name":"low density lipoprotein receptor","nameSynonyms":["familial hypercholesterolemia"],"hgncId":"HGNC:6547","uuid":"bcd84254-7998-44a7-bf8e-88a720655e4e"}],"countryOfOrigin":"","method":{"previousTesting":true,"additionalInformation":"","specificMutationsGenotypedMethod":"Sequencing of promoter, exons, and exon-intron boundaries of PCSK9.

hypercholesterolemia (FH) is an autosomal dominant disease caused by pathogenic variants in genes encoding for LDL receptor (LDLR), Apolipoprotein B and Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9). Among PCSK9 variants, only Gain-of- Function (GOF) variants lead to FH. Greater attention should be paid to the classification of variants as pathogenic. Two hundred sixty nine patients with a clinical suspect of FH were screened for variants in LDLR and the patients without pathogenic variants were screened for variants in PCSK9 and APOB. Functional characterization of PCSK9 variants was performed by assessment of protein secretion, of LDLR activity in presence of PCSK9 variant proteins as well as of the LDLR affinity of the PCSK9 variants. Among 81 patients without pathogenic variants in LDLR, 7 PCSK9 heterozygotes were found, 4 of whom were carriers of variants whose role in FH pathogenesis is still unknown. Functional characterization revealed that two variants (p.(Ser636Arg) and p.(Arg357Cys)) were GOF variants. In Conclusions, we demonstrated a GOF effect of 2 PCSK9 variants that can be considered as FH-causative variants. The study highlights the important role played by functional characterization in integrating diagnostic procedures when the pathogenicity of new variants has not been previously demonstrated.","date":"2017 Nov 10;7(1):15282.","title":"Identification and in vitro characterization of two new PCSK9 Gain of Function variants found in patients with Familial Hypercholesterolemia.","uuid":"9b84f4cd-471c-491c-9fa6-2771983b4fcb","active":true},"submitted_by":"/users/84a6e93b-5075-4dfb-9de5-a9fcde89abc9/","active":true,"number_individual":"","number_family":"","affiliation":"10026","families":[],"uuid":"4e356d0b-e689-4651-95c5-392ddaa4bfa3","experimentalData":[],"number_experimental":""}],"familyIncluded":[],"schema_version":"6","hpoIdInDiagnosis":["HP:0003124"],"last_modified":"2020-04-29T04:22:00.810485+00:00","hpoIdInElimination":[],"otherGenes":["/genes/LDLR/"],"countryOfOrigin":"","method":{"previousTesting":true,"additionalInformation":"","specificMutationsGenotypedMethod":"Sequencing of promoter, exons, and exon-intron boundaries of PCSK9.

hypercholesterolemia (FH) is an autosomal dominant disease caused by pathogenic variants in genes encoding for LDL receptor (LDLR), Apolipoprotein B and Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9). Among PCSK9 variants, only Gain-of- Function (GOF) variants lead to FH. Greater attention should be paid to the classification of variants as pathogenic. Two hundred sixty nine patients with a clinical suspect of FH were screened for variants in LDLR and the patients without pathogenic variants were screened for variants in PCSK9 and APOB. Functional characterization of PCSK9 variants was performed by assessment of protein secretion, of LDLR activity in presence of PCSK9 variant proteins as well as of the LDLR affinity of the PCSK9 variants. Among 81 patients without pathogenic variants in LDLR, 7 PCSK9 heterozygotes were found, 4 of whom were carriers of variants whose role in FH pathogenesis is still unknown. Functional characterization revealed that two variants (p.(Ser636Arg) and p.(Arg357Cys)) were GOF variants. In Conclusions, we demonstrated a GOF effect of 2 PCSK9 variants that can be considered as FH-causative variants. The study highlights the important role played by functional characterization in integrating diagnostic procedures when the pathogenicity of new variants has not been previously demonstrated.","date":"2017 Nov 10;7(1):15282.","title":"Identification and in vitro characterization of two new PCSK9 Gain of Function variants found in patients with Familial Hypercholesterolemia.","uuid":"9b84f4cd-471c-491c-9fa6-2771983b4fcb","active":true},"submitted_by":"/users/84a6e93b-5075-4dfb-9de5-a9fcde89abc9/","active":true,"number_individual":"","number_family":"","affiliation":"10026","families":[],"uuid":"4e356d0b-e689-4651-95c5-392ddaa4bfa3","experimentalData":[],"number_experimental":""}],"familyIncluded":[],"schema_version":"6","hpoIdInDiagnosis":["HP:0003124"],"last_modified":"2020-04-29T04:22:00.810485+00:00","hpoIdInElimination":[],"otherGenes":["/genes/LDLR/"],"countryOfOrigin":"","method":{"previousTesting":true,"additionalInformation":"","specificMutationsGenotypedMethod":"Sequencing of promoter, exons, and exon-intron boundaries of PCSK9.

hypercholesterolemia (FH) is an autosomal dominant disease caused by pathogenic variants in genes encoding for LDL receptor (LDLR), Apolipoprotein B and Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9). Among PCSK9 variants, only Gain-of- Function (GOF) variants lead to FH. Greater attention should be paid to the classification of variants as pathogenic. Two hundred sixty nine patients with a clinical suspect of FH were screened for variants in LDLR and the patients without pathogenic variants were screened for variants in PCSK9 and APOB. Functional characterization of PCSK9 variants was performed by assessment of protein secretion, of LDLR activity in presence of PCSK9 variant proteins as well as of the LDLR affinity of the PCSK9 variants. Among 81 patients without pathogenic variants in LDLR, 7 PCSK9 heterozygotes were found, 4 of whom were carriers of variants whose role in FH pathogenesis is still unknown. Functional characterization revealed that two variants (p.(Ser636Arg) and p.(Arg357Cys)) were GOF variants. In Conclusions, we demonstrated a GOF effect of 2 PCSK9 variants that can be considered as FH-causative variants. The study highlights the important role played by functional characterization in integrating diagnostic procedures when the pathogenicity of new variants has not been previously demonstrated.","date":"2017 Nov 10;7(1):15282.","title":"Identification and in vitro characterization of two new PCSK9 Gain of Function variants found in patients with Familial Hypercholesterolemia.","uuid":"9b84f4cd-471c-491c-9fa6-2771983b4fcb","active":true},"submitted_by":"/users/84a6e93b-5075-4dfb-9de5-a9fcde89abc9/","active":true,"number_individual":"","number_family":"","affiliation":"10026","families":[],"uuid":"4e356d0b-e689-4651-95c5-392ddaa4bfa3","experimentalData":[],"number_experimental":""}],"familyIncluded":[],"schema_version":"6","hpoIdInDiagnosis":["HP:0003124"],"last_modified":"2020-04-29T04:22:00.810485+00:00","hpoIdInElimination":[],"otherGenes":["/genes/LDLR/"],"countryOfOrigin":"","method":{"previousTesting":true,"additionalInformation":"","specificMutationsGenotypedMethod":"Sequencing of promoter, exons, and exon-intron boundaries of PCSK9.

hypercholesterolemia (FH) is an autosomal dominant disease caused by pathogenic variants in genes encoding for LDL receptor (LDLR), Apolipoprotein B and Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9). Among PCSK9 variants, only Gain-of- Function (GOF) variants lead to FH. Greater attention should be paid to the classification of variants as pathogenic. Two hundred sixty nine patients with a clinical suspect of FH were screened for variants in LDLR and the patients without pathogenic variants were screened for variants in PCSK9 and APOB. Functional characterization of PCSK9 variants was performed by assessment of protein secretion, of LDLR activity in presence of PCSK9 variant proteins as well as of the LDLR affinity of the PCSK9 variants. Among 81 patients without pathogenic variants in LDLR, 7 PCSK9 heterozygotes were found, 4 of whom were carriers of variants whose role in FH pathogenesis is still unknown. Functional characterization revealed that two variants (p.(Ser636Arg) and p.(Arg357Cys)) were GOF variants. In Conclusions, we demonstrated a GOF effect of 2 PCSK9 variants that can be considered as FH-causative variants. The study highlights the important role played by functional characterization in integrating diagnostic procedures when the pathogenicity of new variants has not been previously demonstrated.","date":"2017 Nov 10;7(1):15282.","title":"Identification and in vitro characterization of two new PCSK9 Gain of Function variants found in patients with Familial Hypercholesterolemia.","uuid":"9b84f4cd-471c-491c-9fa6-2771983b4fcb","active":true},"submitted_by":"/users/84a6e93b-5075-4dfb-9de5-a9fcde89abc9/","active":true,"number_individual":"","number_family":"","affiliation":"10026","families":[],"uuid":"4e356d0b-e689-4651-95c5-392ddaa4bfa3","experimentalData":[],"number_experimental":""}],"familyIncluded":[],"schema_version":"6","hpoIdInDiagnosis":["HP:0003124"],"last_modified":"2020-04-29T04:22:00.810485+00:00","hpoIdInElimination":[],"otherGenes":["/genes/LDLR/"],"countryOfOrigin":"","method":{"previousTesting":true,"additionalInformation":"","specificMutationsGenotypedMethod":"Sequencing of promoter, exons, and exon-intron boundaries of PCSK9.

hypercholesterolemia (FH) is an autosomal dominant disease caused by pathogenic variants in genes encoding for LDL receptor (LDLR), Apolipoprotein B and Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9). Among PCSK9 variants, only Gain-of- Function (GOF) variants lead to FH. Greater attention should be paid to the classification of variants as pathogenic. Two hundred sixty nine patients with a clinical suspect of FH were screened for variants in LDLR and the patients without pathogenic variants were screened for variants in PCSK9 and APOB. Functional characterization of PCSK9 variants was performed by assessment of protein secretion, of LDLR activity in presence of PCSK9 variant proteins as well as of the LDLR affinity of the PCSK9 variants. Among 81 patients without pathogenic variants in LDLR, 7 PCSK9 heterozygotes were found, 4 of whom were carriers of variants whose role in FH pathogenesis is still unknown. Functional characterization revealed that two variants (p.(Ser636Arg) and p.(Arg357Cys)) were GOF variants. In Conclusions, we demonstrated a GOF effect of 2 PCSK9 variants that can be considered as FH-causative variants. The study highlights the important role played by functional characterization in integrating diagnostic procedures when the pathogenicity of new variants has not been previously demonstrated.","date":"2017 Nov 10;7(1):15282.","title":"Identification and in vitro characterization of two new PCSK9 Gain of Function variants found in patients with Familial Hypercholesterolemia.","uuid":"9b84f4cd-471c-491c-9fa6-2771983b4fcb","active":true},"submitted_by":"/users/84a6e93b-5075-4dfb-9de5-a9fcde89abc9/","active":true,"number_individual":"","number_family":"","affiliation":"10026","families":[],"uuid":"4e356d0b-e689-4651-95c5-392ddaa4bfa3","experimentalData":[],"number_experimental":""}],"familyIncluded":[],"schema_version":"6","hpoIdInDiagnosis":["HP:0003124"],"last_modified":"2020-04-29T04:22:00.810485+00:00","hpoIdInElimination":[],"otherGenes":["/genes/LDLR/"],"countryOfOrigin":"","method":{"previousTesting":true,"additionalInformation":"","specificMutationsGenotypedMethod":"Sequencing of promoter, exons, and exon-intron boundaries of PCSK9.

hypercholesterolemia (FH) is an autosomal dominant disease caused by pathogenic variants in genes encoding for LDL receptor (LDLR), Apolipoprotein B and Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9). Among PCSK9 variants, only Gain-of- Function (GOF) variants lead to FH. Greater attention should be paid to the classification of variants as pathogenic. Two hundred sixty nine patients with a clinical suspect of FH were screened for variants in LDLR and the patients without pathogenic variants were screened for variants in PCSK9 and APOB. Functional characterization of PCSK9 variants was performed by assessment of protein secretion, of LDLR activity in presence of PCSK9 variant proteins as well as of the LDLR affinity of the PCSK9 variants. Among 81 patients without pathogenic variants in LDLR, 7 PCSK9 heterozygotes were found, 4 of whom were carriers of variants whose role in FH pathogenesis is still unknown. Functional characterization revealed that two variants (p.(Ser636Arg) and p.(Arg357Cys)) were GOF variants. In Conclusions, we demonstrated a GOF effect of 2 PCSK9 variants that can be considered as FH-causative variants. The study highlights the important role played by functional characterization in integrating diagnostic procedures when the pathogenicity of new variants has not been previously demonstrated.","date":"2017 Nov 10;7(1):15282.","title":"Identification and in vitro characterization of two new PCSK9 Gain of Function variants found in patients with Familial Hypercholesterolemia.","uuid":"9b84f4cd-471c-491c-9fa6-2771983b4fcb","active":true},"submitted_by":"/users/84a6e93b-5075-4dfb-9de5-a9fcde89abc9/","active":true,"number_individual":"","number_family":"","affiliation":"10026","families":[],"uuid":"4e356d0b-e689-4651-95c5-392ddaa4bfa3","experimentalData":[],"number_experimental":""}],"familyIncluded":[],"schema_version":"6","hpoIdInDiagnosis":["HP:0003124"],"last_modified":"2020-04-29T04:22:00.810485+00:00","hpoIdInElimination":[],"otherGenes":["/genes/LDLR/"],"countryOfOrigin":"","method":{"previousTesting":true,"additionalInformation":"","specificMutationsGenotypedMethod":"Sequencing of promoter, exons, and exon-intron boundaries of PCSK9.

hypercholesterolemia (FH) is an autosomal dominant disease caused by pathogenic variants in genes encoding for LDL receptor (LDLR), Apolipoprotein B and Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9). Among PCSK9 variants, only Gain-of- Function (GOF) variants lead to FH. Greater attention should be paid to the classification of variants as pathogenic. Two hundred sixty nine patients with a clinical suspect of FH were screened for variants in LDLR and the patients without pathogenic variants were screened for variants in PCSK9 and APOB. Functional characterization of PCSK9 variants was performed by assessment of protein secretion, of LDLR activity in presence of PCSK9 variant proteins as well as of the LDLR affinity of the PCSK9 variants. Among 81 patients without pathogenic variants in LDLR, 7 PCSK9 heterozygotes were found, 4 of whom were carriers of variants whose role in FH pathogenesis is still unknown. Functional characterization revealed that two variants (p.(Ser636Arg) and p.(Arg357Cys)) were GOF variants.

hypercholesterolemia (FH) is an autosomal dominant disease caused by pathogenic variants in genes encoding for LDL receptor (LDLR), Apolipoprotein B and Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9). Among PCSK9 variants, only Gain-of- Function (GOF) variants lead to FH. Greater attention should be paid to the classification of variants as pathogenic. Two hundred sixty nine patients with a clinical suspect of FH were screened for variants in LDLR and the patients without pathogenic variants were screened for variants in PCSK9 and APOB. Functional characterization of PCSK9 variants was performed by assessment of protein secretion, of LDLR activity in presence of PCSK9 variant proteins as well as of the LDLR affinity of the PCSK9 variants. Among 81 patients without pathogenic variants in LDLR, 7 PCSK9 heterozygotes were found, 4 of whom were carriers of variants whose role in FH pathogenesis is still unknown. Functional characterization revealed that two variants (p.(Ser636Arg) and p.(Arg357Cys)) were GOF variants. In Conclusions, we demonstrated a GOF effect of 2 PCSK9 variants that can be considered as FH-causative variants. The study highlights the important role played by functional characterization in integrating diagnostic procedures when the pathogenicity of new variants has not been previously demonstrated.","date":"2017 Nov 10;7(1):15282.","title":"Identification and in vitro characterization of two new PCSK9 Gain of Function variants found in patients with Familial

Pcsk9 expression is down-regulated by dietary cholesterol, and mutations in Pcsk9 have been associated with a form of autosomal dominant hypercholesterolemia. To study the function of Pcsk9 in mice, an adenovirus constitutively expressing murine Pcsk9 (Pcsk9-Ad) was used. Pcsk9 overexpression in wild-type mice caused a 2-fold increase in plasma total cholesterol and a 5-fold increase in non-high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, with no increase in HDL cholesterol, as compared with mice infected with a control adenovirus. Fast protein liquid chromatography analysis showed that the increase in non-HDL cholesterol was due to an increase in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. This effect appeared to depend on the LDL receptor (LDLR) because LDLR knockout mice infected with Pcsk9-Ad had no change in plasma cholesterol levels as compared with knockout mice infected with a control adenovirus. Furthermore, whereas overexpression of Pcsk9 had no effect on LDLR mRNA levels, there was a near absence of LDLR protein in animals overexpressing Pcsk9. These results were confirmed in vitro by the demonstration that transfection of Pcsk9 in McA-RH7777 cells caused a reduction in LDLR protein and LDL binding. In summary, these results indicate that overexpression of Pcsk9 interferes with LDLR-mediated LDL cholesterol uptake. Because Pcsk9 and LDLR are coordinately regulated by cholesterol, Pcsk9 may be involved in a novel mechanism to modulate LDLR function by an alternative pathway than classic cholesterol inhibition of sterol regulatory element binding protein-mediated transcription.","date":"2004 May 4;101(18):7100-5.","title":"Adenoviral-mediated expression of Pcsk9 in mice results in a low-density lipoprotein

subtilisin kexin 9 (Pcsk9) is a subtilisin serine protease with a putative role in cholesterol metabolism. Pcsk9 expression is down-regulated by dietary cholesterol, and mutations in Pcsk9 have been associated with a form of autosomal dominant hypercholesterolemia. To study the function of Pcsk9 in mice, an adenovirus constitutively expressing murine Pcsk9 (Pcsk9-Ad) was used. Pcsk9 overexpression in wild-type mice caused a 2-fold increase in plasma total cholesterol and a 5-fold increase in non-high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, with no increase in HDL cholesterol, as compared with mice infected with a control adenovirus. Fast protein liquid chromatography analysis showed that the increase in non-HDL cholesterol was due to an increase in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. This effect appeared to depend on the LDL receptor (LDLR) because LDLR knockout mice infected with Pcsk9-Ad had no change in plasma cholesterol levels as compared with knockout mice infected with a control adenovirus. Furthermore, whereas overexpression of Pcsk9 had no effect on LDLR mRNA levels, there was a near absence of LDLR protein in animals overexpressing Pcsk9. These results were confirmed in vitro by the demonstration that transfection of Pcsk9 in McA-RH7777 cells caused a reduction in LDLR protein and LDL binding. In summary, these results indicate that overexpression of Pcsk9 interferes with LDLR-mediated LDL cholesterol uptake. Because Pcsk9 and LDLR are coordinately regulated by cholesterol, Pcsk9 may be involved in a novel mechanism to modulate LDLR function by an alternative pathway than classic cholesterol inhibition of sterol regulatory element binding protein-mediated transcription.","date":"2004 May 4;101(18):7100-5.","title":"Adenoviral-mediated expression of Pcsk9 in mice results in a low-density lipoprotein receptor knockout phenotype.","uuid":"6725760f-9259-4cff-9d4c-57ba76a0b373","active":true},"submitted_by":"/users/84a6e93b-5075-4dfb-9de5-a9fcde89abc9/","active":true,"number_individual":"","number_family":"","affiliation":"10026","families":[],"uuid":"83212e06-20f4-4b19-b36c-6cfcad34a3c9","experimentalData":["/experimental/ec0a472b-a787-4c64-8941-bd74a33adba2/"],"number_experimental":1}],"functionalAlteration":{},"schema_version":"8","expression":{"organOfTissue":[],"normalExpression":{},"alteredExpression":{}},"proteinInteractions":{},"label":"PCSK9 overexpression in mice","uuid":"ec0a472b-a787-4c64-8941-bd74a33adba2","modelSystems":{"modelSystemsType":"Non-human model organism","nonHumanModel":"Mouse (Mus musculus) 10090","explanation":"Adenovirus constitutively expressing murine Pcsk9 (Pcsk9-Ad) was introduced in C57BL/6 wild type mice.

PCSK9 expression is regulated by dietary cholesterol in mice and cellular sterol levels in cell culture via the sterol regulatory element binding protein transcription factors, and mutations in PCSK9 are associated with a form of autosomal dominant hypercholesterolemia. Overexpression of PCSK9 in mice leads to increased total and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels because of a decrease in hepatic LDL receptor (LDLR) protein with normal mRNA levels. To study the mechanism, PCSK9 was overexpressed in human hepatoma cells, HepG2, by adenovirus. Overexpression of PCSK9 in HepG2 cells caused a decrease in whole-cell and cell-surface LDLR levels. PCSK9 overexpression had no effect on LDLR synthesis but caused a dramatic increase in the degradation of the mature LDLR and a lesser increase in the degradation of the precursor LDLR. In contrast, overexpression of a catalytically inactive mutant PCSK9 prevented the degradation of the mature LDLR; whereas increased degradation of the precursor LDLR still occurred. The PCSK9-induced degradation of the LDLR was not affected by inhibitors of the proteasome, lysosomal cysteine proteases, aspartic acid proteases, or metalloproteases. The PCSK9-induced degradation of the LDLR was shown to require transport out of the endoplasmic reticulum. These results indicate that overexpression of PCSK9 induces the degradation of the LDLR by a nonproteasomal mechanism in a post-endoplasmic reticulum compartment.","date":"2005 Feb

subtilisin kexin 9 (PCSK9) is a member of the subtilisin serine protease family with an important role in cholesterol metabolism. PCSK9 expression is regulated by dietary cholesterol in mice and cellular sterol levels in cell culture via the sterol regulatory element binding protein transcription factors, and mutations in PCSK9 are associated with a form of autosomal dominant hypercholesterolemia. Overexpression of PCSK9 in mice leads to increased total and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels because of a decrease in hepatic LDL receptor (LDLR) protein with normal mRNA levels. To study the mechanism, PCSK9 was overexpressed in human hepatoma cells, HepG2, by adenovirus. Overexpression of PCSK9 in HepG2 cells caused a decrease in whole-cell and cell-surface LDLR levels. PCSK9 overexpression had no effect on LDLR synthesis but caused a dramatic increase in the degradation of the mature LDLR and a lesser increase in the degradation of the precursor LDLR. In contrast, overexpression of a catalytically inactive mutant PCSK9 prevented the degradation of the mature LDLR; whereas increased degradation of the precursor LDLR still occurred. The PCSK9-induced degradation of the LDLR was not affected by inhibitors of the proteasome, lysosomal cysteine proteases, aspartic acid proteases, or metalloproteases. The PCSK9-induced degradation of the LDLR was shown to require transport out of the endoplasmic reticulum. These results indicate that overexpression of PCSK9 induces the degradation of the LDLR by a nonproteasomal mechanism in a post-endoplasmic reticulum compartment.","date":"2005 Feb 8;102(6):2069-74.","title":"Overexpression of PCSK9 accelerates the degradation of the LDLR in a post-endoplasmic reticulum compartment.","uuid":"dee8eef9-8252-4811-b872-c7d223b81f19","active":true},"submitted_by":"/users/84a6e93b-5075-4dfb-9de5-a9fcde89abc9/","active":true,"number_individual":"","number_family":"","affiliation":"10026","families":[],"uuid":"f7cf352e-73c8-43c4-bdfa-12fbd04e3635","experimentalData":["/experimental/0142f244-1f61-4d5c-bbde-bd46ad134b64/"],"number_experimental":1}],"functionalAlteration":{},"schema_version":"8","expression":{"organOfTissue":[],"normalExpression":{},"alteredExpression":{}},"proteinInteractions":{},"label":"PCSK-9 induced degradation of LDLR","uuid":"0142f244-1f61-4d5c-bbde-bd46ad134b64","modelSystems":{},"assessments":[],"scores":[{"experimental_scored":["/experimental/0142f244-1f61-4d5c-bbde-bd46ad134b64/"],"@id":"/evidencescore/6261063f-a4de-4b3c-a69e-9d2b94393707/","individual_scored":[],"scoreStatus":"Score","status":"in progress","date_created":"2018-11-14T14:00:31.291180+00:00","modified_by":{"@id":"/users/c0a70214-08a8-48a0-ba8d-521bed321d4a/","last_name":"Wright","date_created":"2016-11-04T07:00:00+00:00","affiliation":["10006","10005","10009","10011","10018","10019","10007","10034","10048","10049","10003","10042","10021","10012","10013","10014","10057","10058","10059","10060","10061","10062","10015","10023","10016","10008","10026"],"lab":"/labs/curator/","@type":["user","item"],"email":"wrightmw@stanford.edu","title":"Matt Wright","uuid":"c0a70214-08a8-48a0-ba8d-521bed321d4a","first_name":"Matt","user_status":"active"},"evidenceType":"Experimental","@type":["evidenceScore","item"],"affiliation":"10026","calculatedScore":0.5,"scoreExplanation":"Well-established mechanism.","evidenceScored":"0142f244-1f61-4d5c-bbde-bd46ad134b64","schema_version":"2","submitted_by":{"@id":"/users/84a6e93b-5075-4dfb-9de5-a9fcde89abc9/","last_name":"McGlaughon","date_created":"2017-01-05T08:00:00+00:00","affiliation":["10003","10008","10009","10010","10011","10023","10026","10049"],"lab":"/labs/curator/","@type":["user","item"],"email":"jennifer.mcglaughon@gmail.com","title":"Jen McGlaughon","uuid":"84a6e93b-5075-4dfb-9de5-a9fcde89abc9","first_name":"Jen","user_status":"active"},"last_modified":"2020-04-29T04:22:01.055888+00:00","caseControl_scored":[],"score":1,"uuid":"6261063f-a4de-4b3c-a69e-9d2b94393707"}],"evidenceType":"Biochemical Function","@type":["experimental","item"],"affiliation":"10026","modified_by":{"@id":"/users/c0a70214-08a8-48a0-ba8d-521bed321d4a/","last_name":"Wright","date_created":"2016-11-04T07:00:00+00:00","affiliation":["10006","10005","10009","10011","10018","10019","10007","10034","10048","10049","10003","10042","10021","10012","10013","10014","10057","10058","10059","10060","10061","10062","10015","10023","10016","10008","10026"],"lab":"/labs/curator/","@type":["user","item"],"email":"wrightmw@stanford.edu","title":"Matt Wright","uuid":"c0a70214-08a8-48a0-ba8d-521bed321d4a","first_name":"Matt","user_status":"active"},"biochemicalFunction":{"identifiedFunction":"GO:1905598","evidenceForFunction":"Overexpression of PCSK9 in mice (and missense mutations in humans) leads to an increase in LDL cholesterol.

The discovery of the LDL receptor as one of the causative genes of FH enabled us to understand the pathophysiology of FH and paved the way for developing statins. Similar to LDL receptor, discovery of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) also created an opportunity for developing its inhibitors. Since PCSK9 degrades LDL receptor protein, inhibiting PCSK9 will be an effective strategy. Evolocumab and alirocumab, anti-PCSK9 antibodies that inhibit binding between PCSK9 and LDL receptors, are now available in Japan. Adding an anti-PCSK9 antibody to standard therapy with statin alone or statin combined with ezetimibe further reduced serum LDL cholesterol levels by around 60% and they significantly decrease cardiovascular event incidence as compared with placebo. Additionally, the strong LDL cholesterol lowering effect of anti-PCSK9 antibody therapies has reportedly enabled the frequency of lipoprotein apheresis to be reduced or to be discontinued. As alternative strategies against PCSK9, antisense oligonucleotide agents that inhibit PCSK9 protein synthesis as well as a small interfering (or short interference) RNA (siRNA) for PCSK9 are also being developed. While relatively high cost can be given as a problem, PCSK9 inhibitors are able to reduce LDL cholesterol dramatically even in FH patients who could not achieve targets until now. To ensure that these drugs are given to the patients who really need them, it is necessary to raise the diagnosis rate and family screening has to be more actively conducted. Finally, it has been reported that PCSK9 is expressed not only in hepatocytes but also in other cells such as epithelial cells in small intestine and vascular smooth muscle cells in atherosclerotic plaque. Further research regarding extra-hepatic pathophysiology of PCSK9 is expected.","date":"2018 Jan;71(1):1-7.","title":"PCSK9 inhibition in the management of familial

hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a frequent hereditary metabolic disease characterized by high serum low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol concentration and premature atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). The discovery of the LDL receptor as one of the causative genes of FH enabled us to understand the pathophysiology of FH and paved the way for developing statins. Similar to LDL receptor, discovery of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) also created an opportunity for developing its inhibitors. Since PCSK9 degrades LDL receptor protein, inhibiting PCSK9 will be an effective strategy. Evolocumab and alirocumab, anti-PCSK9 antibodies that inhibit binding between PCSK9 and LDL receptors, are now available in Japan. Adding an anti-PCSK9 antibody to standard therapy with statin alone or statin combined with ezetimibe further reduced serum LDL cholesterol levels by around 60% and they significantly decrease cardiovascular event incidence as compared with placebo. Additionally, the strong LDL cholesterol lowering effect of anti-PCSK9 antibody therapies has reportedly enabled the frequency of lipoprotein apheresis to be reduced or to be discontinued. As alternative strategies against PCSK9, antisense oligonucleotide agents that inhibit PCSK9 protein synthesis as well as a small interfering (or short interference) RNA (siRNA) for PCSK9 are also being developed. While relatively high cost can be given as a problem, PCSK9 inhibitors are able to reduce LDL cholesterol dramatically even in FH patients who could not achieve targets until now. To ensure that these drugs are given to the patients who really need them, it is necessary to raise the diagnosis rate and family screening has to be more actively conducted. Finally, it has been reported that PCSK9 is expressed not only in hepatocytes but also in other cells such as epithelial cells in small intestine and vascular smooth muscle cells in atherosclerotic plaque. Further research regarding extra-hepatic pathophysiology of PCSK9 is expected.","date":"2018 Jan;71(1):1-7.","title":"PCSK9 inhibition in the management of familial hypercholesterolemia.","uuid":"ea1d786c-ad46-4a4f-9d85-d784e0f5a406","active":true},"submitted_by":"/users/84a6e93b-5075-4dfb-9de5-a9fcde89abc9/","active":true,"number_individual":"","number_family":"","affiliation":"10026","families":[],"uuid":"ac39c66a-f079-4e23-a5b8-3d8076318814","experimentalData":["/experimental/0e1edeb9-afd3-4423-a4cb-810967720390/"],"number_experimental":1}],"functionalAlteration":{},"schema_version":"8","expression":{"organOfTissue":[],"normalExpression":{},"alteredExpression":{}},"proteinInteractions":{},"label":"PCSK9 inhibition as a treatment for FH","uuid":"0e1edeb9-afd3-4423-a4cb-810967720390","modelSystems":{},"assessments":[],"scores":[{"experimental_scored":["/experimental/0e1edeb9-afd3-4423-a4cb-810967720390/"],"@id":"/evidencescore/38cf47e7-745c-42fd-af58-7096dbbab7a5/","individual_scored":[],"scoreStatus":"Score","status":"in progress","date_created":"2018-11-14T14:01:54.541425+00:00","modified_by":{"@id":"/users/c0a70214-08a8-48a0-ba8d-521bed321d4a/","last_name":"Wright","date_created":"2016-11-04T07:00:00+00:00","affiliation":["10006","10005","10009","10011","10018","10019","10007","10034","10048","10049","10003","10042","10021","10012","10013","10014","10057","10058","10059","10060","10061","10062","10015","10023","10016","10008","10026"],"lab":"/labs/curator/","@type":["user","item"],"email":"wrightmw@stanford.edu","title":"Matt Wright","uuid":"c0a70214-08a8-48a0-ba8d-521bed321d4a","first_name":"Matt","user_status":"active"},"evidenceType":"Experimental","@type":["evidenceScore","item"],"affiliation":"10026","calculatedScore":2,"scoreExplanation":"Unclear whether any of the patients actually had PCSK9 variants vs variants in LDLR or APOB.","evidenceScored":"0e1edeb9-afd3-4423-a4cb-810967720390","schema_version":"2","submitted_by":{"@id":"/users/84a6e93b-5075-4dfb-9de5-a9fcde89abc9/","last_name":"McGlaughon","date_created":"2017-01-05T08:00:00+00:00","affiliation":["10003","10008","10009","10010","10011","10023","10026","10049"],"lab":"/labs/curator/","@type":["user","item"],"email":"jennifer.mcglaughon@gmail.com","title":"Jen McGlaughon","uuid":"84a6e93b-5075-4dfb-9de5-a9fcde89abc9","first_name":"Jen","user_status":"active"},"last_modified":"2020-04-29T04:22:01.132893+00:00","caseControl_scored":[],"score":0,"uuid":"38cf47e7-745c-42fd-af58-7096dbbab7a5"}],"evidenceType":"Rescue","@type":["experimental","item"],"affiliation":"10026","modified_by":{"@id":"/users/c0a70214-08a8-48a0-ba8d-521bed321d4a/","last_name":"Wright","date_created":"2016-11-04T07:00:00+00:00","affiliation":["10006","10005","10009","10011","10018","10019","10007","10034","10048","10049","10003","10042","10021","10012","10013","10014","10057","10058","10059","10060","10061","10062","10015","10023","10016","10008","10026"],"lab":"/labs/curator/","@type":["user","item"],"email":"wrightmw@stanford.edu","title":"Matt Wright","uuid":"c0a70214-08a8-48a0-ba8d-521bed321d4a","first_name":"Matt","user_status":"active"},"biochemicalFunction":{"geneFunctionConsistentWithPhenotype":{"phenotypeHPO":[]},"geneWithSameFunctionSameDisease":{}},"status":"in progress","active":true,"last_modified":"2020-04-29T04:22:01.131554+00:00","rescue":{"wildTypeRescuePhenotype":true,"rescueMethod":"PCSK9 variants cause FH through a dominant negative mechanism.

Variants in PCSK9 were first reported in humans with this disease as early as 2003 (Abifadel et al., PMID: 12730697). At least 15 variants (missense) have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data, segregation data, and experimental data. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 17 probands in 6 publications (PMIDs: 12730697, 15772090, 22683120, 26541928, 29127338, 20006333). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in at least 31 family members. The mechanism for disease is heterozygous gain of function (Maxwell et al., 2005; PMID: 16577715), while heterozygous loss of function variants are associated with low levels of LDL cholesterol (Cohen et al., 2005, PMID: 15654334). This gene-disease association is supported by animal models, expression studies, and in vitro functional assays. In summary, PCSK9 is definitively associated with autosomal dominant familial hypercholesterolemia. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.","associatedClassificationSnapshots":[{"resourceType":"classification","resourceId":"bf710ddc-c189-419f-ab70-25300b067db2","resource":{"classificationPoints":{"experimentalEvidenceTotal":4,"autosomalDominantOrXlinkedDisorder":{"variantIsDeNovo":{"pointsCounted":0,"totalPointsGiven":0,"evidenceCount":0},"probandWithOtherVariantTypeWithGeneImpact":{"pointsCounted":7,"totalPointsGiven":7.05,"evidenceCount":17},"probandWithPredictedOrProvenNullVariant":{"pointsCounted":0,"totalPointsGiven":0,"evidenceCount":0}},"modelsRescue":{"modelsNonHuman":{"totalPointsGiven":2,"evidenceCount":1},"rescuePatientCells":{"totalPointsGiven":0,"evidenceCount":0},"rescueHuman":{"totalPointsGiven":0,"evidenceCount":1},"rescueCellCulture":{"totalPointsGiven":0,"evidenceCount":0},"pointsCounted":2,"totalPointsGiven":2,"rescueNonHuman":{"totalPointsGiven":0,"evidenceCount":0},"modelsCellCulture":{"totalPointsGiven":0,"evidenceCount":0}},"evidencePointsTotal":12.5,"caseControl":{"pointsCounted":0,"totalPointsGiven":0,"evidenceCount":0},"autosomalRecessiveDisorder":{"pointsCounted":0,"twoVariantsInTransWithOneDeNovo":{"totalPointsGiven":0,"evidenceCount":0},"twoVariantsWithGeneImpactInTrans":{"totalPointsGiven":0,"evidenceCount":0}},"function":{"pointsCounted":2,"biochemicalFunctions":{"totalPointsGiven":1,"evidenceCount":1},"expression":{"totalPointsGiven":0.5,"evidenceCount":1},"proteinInteractions":{"totalPointsGiven":0.5,"evidenceCount":1},"totalPointsGiven":2},"functionalAlteration":{"pointsCounted":0,"patientCells":{"totalPointsGiven":0,"evidenceCount":0},"totalPointsGiven":0,"nonPatientCells":{"totalPointsGiven":0,"evidenceCount":0}},"geneticEvidenceTotal":8.5,"segregation":{"evidenceCountExome":0,"evidenceCountCandidate":3,"totalPointsGiven":8.48,"pointsCounted":1.5,"evidencePointsCandidate":8.48,"evidenceCountTotal":3,"evidencePointsExome":0}},"@id":"/provisional/bf710ddc-c189-419f-ab70-25300b067db2/","contradictingEvidence":{"caseControl":false,"proband":false,"experimental":false},"date_created":"2018-02-08T18:10:37.413702+00:00","gdm_associated":["/gdm/fdd3ee83-07d1-42f4-88d9-81874a6369fc/"],"reasons":"","provisionalDate":"2018-11-14T16:37:40.972Z","publishClassification":false,"classificationDate":"2018-11-14T16:37:20.564Z","autoClassification":"Definitive","replicatedOverTime":true,"schema_version":"7","approvedClassification":false,"modified_by":"/users/84a6e93b-5075-4dfb-9de5-a9fcde89abc9/","alteredClassification":"No Modification","@type":["provisionalClassification","item"],"provisionalSubmitter":"Jen McGlaughon","classificationStatus":"Provisional","uuid":"bf710ddc-c189-419f-ab70-25300b067db2","provisionedClassification":true,"submitted_by":"/users/84a6e93b-5075-4dfb-9de5-a9fcde89abc9/","active":true,"last_modified":"2018-11-14T16:37:41.283988+00:00","evidenceSummary":"The relationship between PCSK9 and familial hypercholesterolemia (autosomal dominant) was evaluated using the ClinGen Clinical Validity Framework as of November 14, 2018.
