The first patients with FA complementation group E were reported in 1996 (PMID: 9147877, 7662964). Five homozygous variants in the FANCE gene were observed in individuals with FA complementation group E, and three of these variants were reported to segregate with disease in three small families, suggesting homozygous loss of function is the mechanism of tumorigenesis for this disorder (PMID: 11001585, 17924555). This gene-disease relationship is further supported by rescue cell culture model, protein interaction and functional alteration studies. In summary, FANCE is definitively associated with FA complementation group E. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time.","modified_by":"/users/e0c1a778-ac7d-4c76-80ee-0c709ff8b25e/","gdm_associated":["/gdm/4469ccec-b8ae-4e2d-84dc-d468775361cd/"],"provisionedClassification":true,"classificationApprover":"Sharon Plon"},"approvalStatus":"Approved","date_created":"2020-05-14T00:17:48.135424+00:00","resourceParent":{"gdm":{"@type":["gdm","item"],"gene":{"uuid":"4f315cfb-0fb7-472e-9cd0-e77b02cf965d","pmids":["7662964","11001585"],"@type":["gene","item"],"name":"Fanconi anemia, complementation group E","omimIds":["613976"],"hgncId":"HGNC:3586","previousSymbols":["FACE"],"entrezId":"2178","@id":"/genes/FANCE/","schema_version":"1","synonyms":["FAE"],"locusType":"gene with protein product","previousNames":[],"status":"current","chromosome":"6p21.31","nameSynonyms":[],"hgncStatus":"Approved","symbol":"FANCE"},"active":true,"uuid":"4469ccec-b8ae-4e2d-84dc-d468775361cd","gdm_status":"Summary/Provisional Classifications","annotations":[{"submitted_by":{"uuid":"10795825-ce6d-496c-9629-b18a2ef0cc17","user_status":"active","@type":["user","item"],"last_name":"Zhang","email":"fengli.zhang@slh.wisc.edu","title":"Fengli Zhang","@id":"/users/10795825-ce6d-496c-9629-b18a2ef0cc17/","date_created":"2019-09-03T07:00:00+00:00","affiliation":["10023"],"first_name":"Fengli","lab":"/labs/curator/"},"@type":["annotation","item"],"active":true,"uuid":"17e551cf-0dc9-4a57-9651-71c57147e061","number_experimental":"","affiliation":"10023","number_family":3,"experimentalData":[],"@id":"/evidence/17e551cf-0dc9-4a57-9651-71c57147e061/","schema_version":"4","number_individual":"","individuals":[],"modified_by":"/users/10795825-ce6d-496c-9629-b18a2ef0cc17/","last_modified":"2020-04-09T21:54:06.779041+00:00","status":"in progress","number_group":"","date_created":"2020-04-08T19:50:37.729165+00:00","associatedGdm":["/gdm/4469ccec-b8ae-4e2d-84dc-d468775361cd/"],"families":[{"@type":["family","item"],"label":"Family 2 from Banglades(PMID: 10205272)","associatedGroups":[],"active":true,"uuid":"b4afb582-1934-4c11-8f6c-bcabcc5ddc53","modified_by":{"uuid":"10795825-ce6d-496c-9629-b18a2ef0cc17","user_status":"active","@type":["user","item"],"last_name":"Zhang","email":"fengli.zhang@slh.wisc.edu","title":"Fengli Zhang","@id":"/users/10795825-ce6d-496c-9629-b18a2ef0cc17/","date_created":"2019-09-03T07:00:00+00:00","affiliation":["10023"],"first_name":"Fengli","lab":"/labs/curator/"},"otherPMIDs":[{"uuid":"aee3ca77-817f-4232-a303-4820cf9a7f43","@type":["article","item"],"active":true,"submitted_by":{"uuid":"10795825-ce6d-496c-9629-b18a2ef0cc17","user_status":"active","@type":["user","item"],"last_name":"Zhang","email":"fengli.zhang@slh.wisc.edu","title":"Fengli Zhang","@id":"/users/10795825-ce6d-496c-9629-b18a2ef0cc17/","date_created":"2019-09-03T07:00:00+00:00","affiliation":["10023"],"first_name":"Fengli","lab":"/labs/curator/"},"pmcid":"","authors":["Waisfisz Q","Saar K","Morgan NV","Altay C","Leegwater PA","de Winter JP","Komatsu K","Evans GR","Wegner RD","Reis A","Joenje H","Arwert F","Mathew CG","Pronk JC","Digweed M"],"pmid":"10205272","@id":"/articles/10205272/","schema_version":"1","last_modified":"2020-04-08T20:45:01.116176+00:00","modified_by":"/users/10795825-ce6d-496c-9629-b18a2ef0cc17/","title":"The Fanconi anemia group E gene, FANCE, maps to chromosome 6p.","abstract":"Fanconi anemia (FA) is a genetically heterogeneous autosomal recessive disease with bone marrow failure and predisposition to cancer as major features, often accompanied by developmental anomalies.

The cells of patients with FA are hypersensitive to DNA cross-linking agents in terms of cell survival and chromosomal breakage. Of the eight complementation groups (FA-A to FA-H) distinguished thus far by cell fusion studies, the genes for three-FANCA, FANCC, and FANCG-have been identified, and the FANCD gene has been localized to chromosome 3p22-26. We report here the use of homozygosity mapping and genetic linkage analysis to map a fifth distinct genetic locus for FA. DNA from three families was assigned to group FA-E by cell fusion and complementation analysis and was then used to localize the FANCE gene to chromosome 6p21-22 in an 18.2-cM region flanked by markers D6S422 and D6S1610. This study shows that data from even a small number of families can be successfully used to map a gene for a genetically heterogeneous disorder.","date":"1999 May;64(5):1400-5.","date_created":"2020-04-08T20:45:01.113854+00:00","journal":"American journal of human genetics","doi":""}],"ageRangeType":"","schema_version":"7","last_modified":"2020-04-09T21:13:52.664739+00:00","individualIncluded":[{"ageType":"","@type":["individual","item"],"label":"EUFA130","modified_by":{"uuid":"10795825-ce6d-496c-9629-b18a2ef0cc17","user_status":"active","@type":["user","item"],"last_name":"Zhang","email":"fengli.zhang@slh.wisc.edu","title":"Fengli Zhang","@id":"/users/10795825-ce6d-496c-9629-b18a2ef0cc17/","date_created":"2019-09-03T07:00:00+00:00","affiliation":["10023"],"first_name":"Fengli","lab":"/labs/curator/"},"active":true,"uuid":"4023aef4-74b4-4dfb-b4af-d90948b2a60f","scores":[{"uuid":"05769788-34d7-49e5-b51a-151859f3a635","scoreStatus":"Score","@type":["evidenceScore","item"],"evidenceType":"Individual","caseControl_scored":[],"caseInfoType":"TWO_VARIANTS_IN_TRANS_WITH_ONE_DE_NOVO","affiliation":"10023","scoreExplanation":"This sequence change creates a premature translational stop signal (p.Gln119*) in the FANCE gene.

The cells of patients with FA are hypersensitive to DNA cross-linking agents in terms of cell survival and chromosomal breakage. Of the eight complementation groups (FA-A to FA-H) distinguished thus far by cell fusion studies, the genes for three-FANCA, FANCC, and FANCG-have been identified, and the FANCD gene has been localized to chromosome 3p22-26. We report here the use of homozygosity mapping and genetic linkage analysis to map a fifth distinct genetic locus for FA. DNA from three families was assigned to group FA-E by cell fusion and complementation analysis and was then used to localize the FANCE gene to chromosome 6p21-22 in an 18.2-cM region flanked by markers D6S422 and D6S1610. This study shows that data from even a small number of families can be successfully used to map a gene for a genetically heterogeneous disorder.","date":"1999 May;64(5):1400-5.","date_created":"2020-04-08T20:45:01.113854+00:00","journal":"American journal of human genetics","doi":""}],"ageRangeType":"","schema_version":"7","last_modified":"2020-04-09T21:54:06.421116+00:00","individualIncluded":[{"ageType":"","@type":["individual","item"],"label":"EUFA622","modified_by":{"uuid":"10795825-ce6d-496c-9629-b18a2ef0cc17","user_status":"active","@type":["user","item"],"last_name":"Zhang","email":"fengli.zhang@slh.wisc.edu","title":"Fengli Zhang","@id":"/users/10795825-ce6d-496c-9629-b18a2ef0cc17/","date_created":"2019-09-03T07:00:00+00:00","affiliation":["10023"],"first_name":"Fengli","lab":"/labs/curator/"},"active":true,"uuid":"8119e899-b404-4960-9f2a-46d15a473a45","scores":[{"uuid":"31e23354-be99-4417-bdd0-433479c30726","scoreStatus":"Score","@type":["evidenceScore","item"],"evidenceType":"Individual","caseControl_scored":[],"caseInfoType":"TWO_VARIANTS_IN_TRANS_WITH_ONE_DE_NOVO","affiliation":"10023","scoreExplanation":"Sequence analysis of cDNA derived from EUFA622 indicated that this mutation results in false splicing and incorporation of six nucleotides from intron 5, including an in-frame stop codon.","@id":"/evidencescore/31e23354-be99-4417-bdd0-433479c30726/","schema_version":"2","individual_scored":["/individuals/8119e899-b404-4960-9f2a-46d15a473a45/"],"last_modified":"2020-04-24T14:15:56.091825+00:00","evidenceScored":"8119e899-b404-4960-9f2a-46d15a473a45","modified_by":{"uuid":"10795825-ce6d-496c-9629-b18a2ef0cc17","user_status":"active","@type":["user","item"],"last_name":"Zhang","email":"fengli.zhang@slh.wisc.edu","title":"Fengli Zhang","@id":"/users/10795825-ce6d-496c-9629-b18a2ef0cc17/","date_created":"2019-09-03T07:00:00+00:00","affiliation":["10023"],"first_name":"Fengli","lab":"/labs/curator/"},"submitted_by":{"uuid":"10795825-ce6d-496c-9629-b18a2ef0cc17","user_status":"active","@type":["user","item"],"last_name":"Zhang","email":"fengli.zhang@slh.wisc.edu","title":"Fengli Zhang","@id":"/users/10795825-ce6d-496c-9629-b18a2ef0cc17/","date_created":"2019-09-03T07:00:00+00:00","affiliation":["10023"],"first_name":"Fengli","lab":"/labs/curator/"},"status":"in progress","date_created":"2020-04-24T14:15:56.091817+00:00","experimental_scored":[],"calculatedScore":2}],"ageUnit":"","otherPMIDs":[{"uuid":"aee3ca77-817f-4232-a303-4820cf9a7f43","@type":["article","item"],"active":true,"submitted_by":{"uuid":"10795825-ce6d-496c-9629-b18a2ef0cc17","user_status":"active","@type":["user","item"],"last_name":"Zhang","email":"fengli.zhang@slh.wisc.edu","title":"Fengli Zhang","@id":"/users/10795825-ce6d-496c-9629-b18a2ef0cc17/","date_created":"2019-09-03T07:00:00+00:00","affiliation":["10023"],"first_name":"Fengli","lab":"/labs/curator/"},"pmcid":"","authors":["Waisfisz Q","Saar K","Morgan NV","Altay C","Leegwater PA","de Winter JP","Komatsu K","Evans GR","Wegner RD","Reis A","Joenje H","Arwert F","Mathew CG","Pronk JC","Digweed M"],"pmid":"10205272","@id":"/articles/10205272/","schema_version":"1","last_modified":"2020-04-08T20:45:01.116176+00:00","modified_by":"/users/10795825-ce6d-496c-9629-b18a2ef0cc17/","title":"The Fanconi anemia group E gene, FANCE, maps to chromosome 6p.","abstract":"Fanconi anemia (FA) is a genetically heterogeneous autosomal recessive disease with bone marrow failure and predisposition to cancer as major features, often accompanied by developmental anomalies.

characterized by bone marrow failure and cellular hypersensitivity to DNA cross-linking agents. In response to DNA damage, the FA pathway is activated through the cooperation of 16 FA proteins. A central player in the pathway is a multisubunit E3 ubiquitin ligase complex or the FA core complex, which monoubiquitinates its substrates FANCD2 and FANCI. FANCE, a subunit of the FA core complex, plays an essential role by promoting the integrity of the complex and by directly recognizing FANCD2. To delineate its role in substrate ubiquitination from the core complex assembly, we analyzed a series of mutations within FANCE. We report that a phenylalanine located at the highly conserved extreme C terminus, referred to as Phe-522, is a critical residue for mediating the monoubiquitination of the FANCD2-FANCI complex. Using the FANCE mutant that specifically disrupts the FANCE-FANCD2 interaction as a tool, we found that the interaction-deficient mutant conferred cellular sensitivity in reconstituted FANCE-deficient cells to a similar degree as FANCE null cells, suggesting the significance of the FANCE-FANCD2 interaction in promoting cisplatin resistance. Intriguingly, ectopic expression of the FANCE C terminus fragment alone in FA normal cells disrupts DNA repair, consolidating the importance of the FANCE-FANCD2 interaction in the DNA cross-link repair.

The 6 known Fanconi anemia gene products (FANCA, FANCC, FANCD2, FANCE, FANCF, and FANCG proteins) interact in a common pathway. The monoubiquitination and nuclear foci formation of FANCD2 are essential for the function of this pathway. FANCA, FANCC, FANCG, and FANCF proteins form a multisubunit nuclear complex (FA complex) required for FANCD2 monoubiquitination. Because FANCE and FANCC interact in vitro and FANCE is required for FANCD2 monoubiquitination, we reasoned that FANCE is a component of the FA complex in vivo. Here we demonstrate that retroviral transduction of Fanconi anemia subtype E (FA-E) cells with the FANCE cDNA restores the nuclear accumulation of FANCC protein, FANCA-FANCC complex formation, monoubiquitination and nuclear foci formation of FANCD2, and mitomycin C resistance. Hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged FANCE protein localizes diffusely in the nucleus. In normal cells, HA-tagged FANCE protein coimmunoprecipitates with FANCA, FANCC, and FANCG but not with FANCD2. Our data indicate that FANCE is a component of the nuclear FA complex in vivo and is required for the monoubiquitination of FANCD2 and the downstream events in the FA pathway.","date":"2002 Oct

In response to DNA damage, a multi-subunit assembly of FA proteins, the FA core complex, monoubiquitinates the downstream FANCD2 protein. The FANCE protein plays an essential role in the FA process of DNA repair as the FANCD2-binding component of the FA core complex. Here we report a crystallographic and biological study of human FANCE. The first structure of a FA protein reveals the presence of a repeated helical motif that provides a template for the structural rationalization of other proteins defective in Fanconi Anaemia. The portion of FANCE defined by our crystallographic analysis is sufficient for interaction with FANCD2, yielding structural information into the mode of FANCD2 recruitment to the FA core complex. Disease-associated mutations disrupt the FANCE-FANCD2 interaction, providing structural insight into the molecular mechanisms of FA pathogenesis.","date":"2007 Feb 18;35(5):1638-48.","date_created":"2020-04-23T01:21:03.503785+00:00","journal":"Nucleic acids research","doi":""}],"@id":"/individuals/8ea866f2-71e8-4b01-b22d-b993703e7ff0/","schema_version":"7","last_modified":"2020-04-24T14:13:42.189561+00:00","assessment_count":0,"status":"in progress","date_created":"2020-04-23T01:21:03.629061+00:00","affiliation":"10023","variants":[{"maneTranscriptTitle":"","@type":["variant","item"],"variationType":"single nucleotide variant","uuid":"9285f539-daf7-42ee-8a0e-f654f3501db6","otherDescription":"","dbSNPIds":["775076977"],"@id":"/variants/9285f539-daf7-42ee-8a0e-f654f3501db6/","schema_version":"6","last_modified":"2020-04-23T03:42:08.332500+00:00","hgvsNames":{"GRCh38":"NC_000006.12:g.35458438C>T","GRCh37":"NC_000006.11:g.35426215C>T","others":["NM_021922.2:c.1111C>T","NP_068741.1:p.Arg371Trp","LRG_498t1:c.1111C>T","LRG_498p1:p.Arg371Trp","NG_011708.1:g.11078C>T","LRG_498:g.11078C>T"]},"carId":"","status":"in progress","molecularConsequenceList":[{"soId":"SO:0001583","term":"missense variant","hgvsName":"NM_021922.2:c.1111C>T"}],"date_created":"2020-04-23T03:42:08.332328+00:00","associatedPathogenicities":[],"source":"ClinVar","variant_identifier":"566449","submitted_by":{"uuid":"10795825-ce6d-496c-9629-b18a2ef0cc17","user_status":"active","@type":["user","item"],"last_name":"Zhang","email":"fengli.zhang@slh.wisc.edu","title":"Fengli Zhang","@id":"/users/10795825-ce6d-496c-9629-b18a2ef0cc17/","date_created":"2019-09-03T07:00:00+00:00","affiliation":["10023"],"first_name":"Fengli","lab":"/labs/curator/"},"clinvarVariantTitle":"NM_021922.2(FANCE):c.1111C>T (p.Arg371Trp)","variation_type":"single nucleotide variant","clinVarSCVs":[],"molecular_consequence":"missense variant","modified_by":"/users/10795825-ce6d-496c-9629-b18a2ef0cc17/","associatedInterpretations":[],"clinVarRCVs":[],"clinvarVariantId":"566449"}],"method":{"additionalInformation":"","previousTestingDescription":"","genotypingMethods":["Sanger sequencing"],"specificMutationsGenotypedMethod":"DHPLC and sequencing of aberrant fragments","dateTime":"2020-04-24T09:13:42-05:00"},"submitted_by":{"uuid":"10795825-ce6d-496c-9629-b18a2ef0cc17","user_status":"active","@type":["user","item"],"last_name":"Zhang","email":"fengli.zhang@slh.wisc.edu","title":"Fengli Zhang","@id":"/users/10795825-ce6d-496c-9629-b18a2ef0cc17/","date_created":"2019-09-03T07:00:00+00:00","affiliation":["10023"],"first_name":"Fengli","lab":"/labs/curator/"},"associatedFamilies":[],"additionalInformation":"This variant disrupts the FANCE\u2013FANCD2 interaction, suggesting the causative effect of this variant in FA pathogenesis.

Hypersensitivity to cross-linking agents is a cellular feature used to confirm the diagnosis. The mode of inheritance is autosomal recessive (12 subtypes) as well as X-linked (one subtype). Most genetic subtypes have initially been defined as \"complementation groups\" by cell fusion studies. Here we report a comprehensive genetic subtyping approach for FA that is primarily based on mutation screening, supplemented by protein expression analysis and by functional assays to test for pathogenicity of unclassified variants. Of 80 FA cases analyzed, 73 (91%) were successfully subtyped. In total, 92 distinct mutations were detected, of which 56 were novel (40 in FANCA, eight in FANCC, two in FANCD1, three in FANCE, one in FANCF, and three in FANCG). All known complementation groups were represented, except D2, J, L, and M. Three patients could not be classified because proliferating cell cultures from the probands were lacking. In cell lines from the remaining four patients, immunoblotting was used to determine their capacity to monoubiquitinate FANCD2. In one case FANCD2 monoubiquitination was normal, indicating a defect downstream. In the remaining three cases monoubiquitination was not detectable, indicating a defect upstream. In the latter four patients, pathogenic mutations in a known FA gene may have been missed, or these patients might represent novel genetic subtypes. We conclude that direct mutation screening allows a molecular diagnosis of FA in the vast majority of patients, even in cases where growing cells from affected individuals are unavailable. Proliferating cell lines are required in a minority (<15%) of the patients, to allow testing for FANCD2 ubiquitination status and sequencing of FANCD2 using cDNA, to avoid interference from pseudogenes.","date":"2008 Jan;29(1):159-66.","date_created":"2020-04-23T01:00:40.971490+00:00","journal":"Human

Hypersensitivity to cross-linking agents is a cellular feature used to confirm the diagnosis. The mode of inheritance is autosomal recessive (12 subtypes) as well as X-linked (one subtype). Most genetic subtypes have initially been defined as \"complementation groups\" by cell fusion studies.

In total, 92 distinct mutations were detected, of which 56 were novel (40 in FANCA, eight in FANCC, two in FANCD1, three in FANCE, one in FANCF, and three in FANCG). All known complementation groups were represented, except D2, J, L, and M. Three patients could not be classified because proliferating cell cultures from the probands were lacking. In cell lines from the remaining four patients, immunoblotting was used to determine their capacity to monoubiquitinate FANCD2. In one case FANCD2 monoubiquitination was normal, indicating a defect downstream. In the remaining three cases monoubiquitination was not detectable, indicating a defect upstream.

We conclude that direct mutation screening allows a molecular diagnosis of FA in the vast majority of patients, even in cases where growing cells from affected individuals are unavailable.

into Fanconi Anaemia from the structure of human FANCE.","abstract":"Fanconi Anaemia (FA) is a cancer predisposition disorder characterized by spontaneous chromosome breakage and high cellular sensitivity to genotoxic agents. In response to DNA damage, a multi-subunit assembly of FA proteins, the FA core complex, monoubiquitinates the downstream FANCD2 protein. The FANCE protein plays an essential role in the FA process of DNA repair as the FANCD2-binding component of the FA core complex. Here we report a crystallographic and biological study of human FANCE.

In response to DNA damage, a multi-subunit assembly of FA proteins, the FA core complex, monoubiquitinates the downstream FANCD2 protein. The FANCE protein plays an essential role in the FA process of DNA repair as the FANCD2-binding component of the FA core complex. Here we report a crystallographic and biological study of human FANCE. The first structure of a FA protein reveals the presence of a repeated helical motif that provides a template for the structural rationalization of other proteins defective in Fanconi Anaemia. The portion of FANCE defined by our crystallographic analysis is sufficient for interaction with FANCD2, yielding structural information into the mode of FANCD2 recruitment to the FA core complex. Disease-associated mutations disrupt the FANCE-FANCD2 interaction, providing structural insight into the molecular mechanisms of FA pathogenesis.","date":"2007 Feb 18;35(5):1638-48.","date_created":"2020-04-23T01:21:03.503785+00:00","journal":"Nucleic acids research","doi":""}}],"modeInheritanceAdjective":"","@id":"/gdm/4469ccec-b8ae-4e2d-84dc-d468775361cd/","audit":{},"last_modified":"2020-04-23T03:21:02.352003+00:00","modeCode":"0","status":"in progress","date_created":"2020-04-08T19:10:43.430481+00:00","omimId":"600901","schema_version":"8","variantPathogenicity":[],"submitted_by":{"uuid":"10795825-ce6d-496c-9629-b18a2ef0cc17","user_status":"active","@type":["user","item"],"last_name":"Zhang","email":"fengli.zhang@slh.wisc.edu","title":"Fengli Zhang","@id":"/users/10795825-ce6d-496c-9629-b18a2ef0cc17/","date_created":"2019-09-03T07:00:00+00:00","affiliation":["10023"],"first_name":"Fengli","lab":"/labs/curator/"},"gdm_title":"FANCE-5143e272-9a40-4b9f-adc7-f324c6a01108-0","affiliation":"10023","number_pathogenicity":"","modeInheritance":"Autosomal recessive inheritance (HP:0000007)","number_provisional":"1","finalClassification":"","actions":[{"title":"Edit","href":"/gdm/4469ccec-b8ae-4e2d-84dc-d468775361cd/#!edit","name":"edit","profile":"/profiles/gdm.json"},{"title":"Edit JSON","href":"/gdm/4469ccec-b8ae-4e2d-84dc-d468775361cd/#!edit-json","name":"edit-json","profile":"/profiles/gdm.json"}],"modified_by":"/users/10795825-ce6d-496c-9629-b18a2ef0cc17/","provisionalClassifications":[{"reasons":"","classificationStatus":"Approved","@type":["provisionalClassification","item"],"active":true,"uuid":"6da55a6e-2cf8-499c-b842-b5a435dbff3f","classificationContributors":[],"publishClassification":false,"sopVersion":"7","@id":"/provisional/6da55a6e-2cf8-499c-b842-b5a435dbff3f/","schema_version":"11","replicatedOverTime":true,"additionalApprover":"40023","classificationPoints":{"autosomalRecessiveDisorder":{"pointsCounted":10,"twoVariantsInTransWithOneDeNovo":{"evidenceCount":5,"totalPointsGiven":10},"twoVariantsWithGeneImpactInTrans":{"evidenceCount":0,"totalPointsGiven":0}},"modelsRescue":{"pointsCounted":2,"rescueHuman":{"evidenceCount":0,"totalPointsGiven":0},"totalPointsGiven":2,"modelsNonHuman":{"evidenceCount":0,"totalPointsGiven":0},"rescuePatientCells":{"evidenceCount":0,"totalPointsGiven":0},"modelsCellCulture":{"evidenceCount":0,"totalPointsGiven":0},"rescueNonHuman":{"evidenceCount":0,"totalPointsGiven":0},"rescueCellCulture":{"evidenceCount":1,"totalPointsGiven":2}},"caseControl":{"pointsCounted":0,"evidenceCount":0,"totalPointsGiven":0},"functionalAlteration":{"pointsCounted":2,"patientCells":{"evidenceCount":2,"totalPointsGiven":2},"totalPointsGiven":2.5,"nonPatientCells":{"evidenceCount":1,"totalPointsGiven":0.5}},"evidencePointsTotal":16,"function":{"proteinInteractions":{"evidenceCount":1,"totalPointsGiven":2},"pointsCounted":2,"biochemicalFunctions":{"evidenceCount":0,"totalPointsGiven":0},"expression":{"evidenceCount":0,"totalPointsGiven":0},"totalPointsGiven":2},"autosomalDominantOrXlinkedDisorder":{"probandWithPredictedOrProvenNullVariant":{"pointsCounted":0,"evidenceCount":0,"totalPointsGiven":0},"variantIsDeNovo":{"pointsCounted":0,"evidenceCount":0,"totalPointsGiven":0},"probandWithOtherVariantTypeWithGeneImpact":{"pointsCounted":0,"evidenceCount":0,"totalPointsGiven":0}},"experimentalEvidenceTotal":6,"geneticEvidenceTotal":10,"segregation":{"pointsCounted":0,"evidenceCountExome":0,"totalPointsGiven":1.33,"evidencePointsCandidate":1.33,"evidenceCountTotal":1,"evidencePointsExome":0,"evidenceCountCandidate":1}},"approvalDate":"2020-05-14T00:17:45.604Z","approvalSubmitter":"Xi Luo","date_created":"2020-04-20T19:00:17.074823+00:00","affiliation":"10023","classificationDate":"2020-05-14T00:12:23.411Z","alteredClassification":"No Modification","submitted_by":{"uuid":"e0c1a778-ac7d-4c76-80ee-0c709ff8b25e","user_status":"active","@type":["user","item"],"last_name":"Luo","email":"xi.luo@bcm.edu","title":"Xi Luo","@id":"/users/e0c1a778-ac7d-4c76-80ee-0c709ff8b25e/","date_created":"2018-01-08T08:00:00+00:00","affiliation":["10012","10014","10023","10026","10034"],"first_name":"Xi","lab":"/labs/curator/"},"autoClassification":"Definitive","contributorComment":"This gene curation was previously curated by Illumina using early version of SOP.
