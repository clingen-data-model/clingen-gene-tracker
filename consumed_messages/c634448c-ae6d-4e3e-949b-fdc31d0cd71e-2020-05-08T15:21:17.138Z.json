Variants in PKP2 were first reported in humans with this disease as early as 2004 (Gerull et al., PMID: 15489853). PKP2 is the major causative gene for ARVC and accounts for 34%-74% of cases (McNAlly et al., 2005; PMID: 20301310).

This gene-disease relationship is well-known and therefore a significant amount of case-level data, segregation data and experimental data is available in the literature, therefore the maximum score for both genetic evidence and experimental evidence has been reached.  Note, this curation effort may not be exhaustive of all literature related to this gene-disease relationship. This gene-disease relationship is supported by animal models, in vitro assays, and protein interactions. In summary, PKP2 is definitively associated with autosomal dominant ARVC.

In a recent report, mutations in plakophilin-2, a gene highly expressed in cardiac desmosomes, have been shown to cause

It is considered a disease of cell adhesion because mutations in desmosomal genes, desmoplakin and plakoglobin, have been implicated in the pathogenesis of ARVC. In a recent report, mutations in plakophilin-2, a gene highly expressed in cardiac desmosomes, have been shown to cause ARVC.","date_created":"2017-03-02T18:28:27.603513+00:00","pmid":"16415378"},"submitted_by":{"title":"Jen McGlaughon","lab":"/labs/curator/","@type":["user","item"],"email":"jennifer.mcglaughon@gmail.com","affiliation":["10003","10008","10009","10010","10011","10023","10026","10049"],"last_name":"McGlaughon","@id":"/users/84a6e93b-5075-4dfb-9de5-a9fcde89abc9/","first_name":"Jen","date_created":"2017-01-05T08:00:00+00:00","user_status":"active","uuid":"84a6e93b-5075-4dfb-9de5-a9fcde89abc9"},"associatedGdm":["/gdm/316ac2fc-555e-4c2e-a0ba-29a7e1663f72/"],"modified_by":"/users/c0a70214-08a8-48a0-ba8d-521bed321d4a/","date_created":"2017-03-02T18:28:27.764300+00:00","number_family":""},{"schema_version":"4","@type":["annotation","item"],"number_individual":"","active":true,"number_group":"","affiliation":"10003","families":[],"status":"in progress","@id":"/evidence/6a33ec04-7103-4149-b238-9c7d9293dc0c/","groups":[],"uuid":"6a33ec04-7103-4149-b238-9c7d9293dc0c","individuals":[],"last_modified":"2019-06-28T15:34:03.037806+00:00","number_experimental":1,"experimentalData":[{"rescue":{},"submitted_by":{"title":"Jen McGlaughon","lab":"/labs/curator/","@type":["user","item"],"email":"jennifer.mcglaughon@gmail.com","affiliation":["10003","10008","10009","10010","10011","10023","10026","10049"],"last_name":"McGlaughon","@id":"/users/84a6e93b-5075-4dfb-9de5-a9fcde89abc9/","first_name":"Jen","date_created":"2017-01-05T08:00:00+00:00","user_status":"active","uuid":"84a6e93b-5075-4dfb-9de5-a9fcde89abc9"},"affiliation":"10003","proteinInteractions":{},"@id":"/experimental/797befd2-46b6-43d8-ad11-d02664d2c97d/","label":"Mertens Expression","functionalAlteration":{},"uuid":"797befd2-46b6-43d8-ad11-d02664d2c97d","last_modified":"2019-06-28T15:34:03.042892+00:00","evidenceType":"Expression","biochemicalFunction":{"geneWithSameFunctionSameDisease":{},"geneFunctionConsistentWithPhenotype":{"phenotypeHPO":[]}},"schema_version":"8","active":true,"@type":["experimental","item"],"status":"in progress","modelSystems":{},"scores":[{"schema_version":"2","individual_scored":[],"submitted_by":{"title":"Jen McGlaughon","lab":"/labs/curator/","@type":["user","item"],"email":"jennifer.mcglaughon@gmail.com","affiliation":["10003","10008","10009","10010","10011","10023","10026","10049"],"last_name":"McGlaughon","@id":"/users/84a6e93b-5075-4dfb-9de5-a9fcde89abc9/","first_name":"Jen","date_created":"2017-01-05T08:00:00+00:00","user_status":"active","uuid":"84a6e93b-5075-4dfb-9de5-a9fcde89abc9"},"@type":["evidenceScore","item"],"affiliation":"10003","status":"in progress","@id":"/evidencescore/d5653ec0-631a-45e7-9a1c-763e64fd4010/","uuid":"d5653ec0-631a-45e7-9a1c-763e64fd4010","caseControl_scored":[],"scoreStatus":"Score","last_modified":"2019-06-28T15:34:03.082171+00:00","calculatedScore":0.5,"evidenceType":"Experimental","date_created":"2017-03-02T19:37:17.432746+00:00","experimental_scored":["/experimental/797befd2-46b6-43d8-ad11-d02664d2c97d/"],"modified_by":{"title":"Matt Wright","lab":"/labs/curator/","@type":["user","item"],"email":"wrightmw@stanford.edu","affiliation":["10006","10005","10009","10011","10018","10019","10007","10034","10048","10049","10003","10042","10021","10012","10013","10014","10057","10058","10059","10060","10061","10062","10015","10023","10016","10008","10026"],"last_name":"Wright","@id":"/users/c0a70214-08a8-48a0-ba8d-521bed321d4a/","first_name":"Matt","date_created":"2016-11-04T07:00:00+00:00","user_status":"active","uuid":"c0a70214-08a8-48a0-ba8d-521bed321d4a"}}],"assessments":[],"associatedAnnotations":[{"schema_version":"4","@type":["annotation","item"],"number_individual":"","active":true,"number_group":"","affiliation":"10003","families":[],"status":"in progress","@id":"/evidence/6a33ec04-7103-4149-b238-9c7d9293dc0c/","groups":[],"uuid":"6a33ec04-7103-4149-b238-9c7d9293dc0c","individuals":[],"last_modified":"2019-06-28T15:34:03.037806+00:00","number_experimental":1,"experimentalData":["/experimental/797befd2-46b6-43d8-ad11-d02664d2c97d/"],"article":{"schema_version":"1","journal":"The Journal of cell biology","date":"1996 Nov;135(4):1009-25.","active":true,"@type":["article","item"],"title":"Plakophilins 2a and 2b: constitutive proteins of dual location in the karyoplasm and the desmosomal plaque.","authors":["Mertens C","Kuhn C","Franke WW"],"@id":"/articles/8922383/","pmcid":"","uuid":"967e6fcf-38c9-4975-b828-4053bf4bc623","doi":"","last_modified":"2017-03-02T19:27:42.687162+00:00","submitted_by":"/users/84a6e93b-5075-4dfb-9de5-a9fcde89abc9/","abstract":"Using antibodies and recombinant DNA techniques, we have identified plakophilin 2, a novel desmosomal plaque protein of M(r) 100,000 (estimated from SDS-PAGE), which is a member of the arm-repeat family of proteins and can occur in two splice forms (2a and 2b) because of the insertion of a 44 amino acid (aa)-encoding exon.

functions as well as a function specific to many but not all desmosomes.","date_created":"2017-03-02T19:27:42.689884+00:00","pmid":"8922383"},"submitted_by":"/users/84a6e93b-5075-4dfb-9de5-a9fcde89abc9/","associatedGdm":[{"modeInheritance":"Autosomal dominant

We conclude that plakophilins 2a and 2b are basic nuclear proteins that in certain cell types additionally assemble with other proteins to form the desmosomal plaque and serve general nuclear functions as well as a function specific to many but not all desmosomes.","date_created":"2017-03-02T19:27:42.689884+00:00","pmid":"8922383"},"submitted_by":{"title":"Jen McGlaughon","lab":"/labs/curator/","@type":["user","item"],"email":"jennifer.mcglaughon@gmail.com","affiliation":["10003","10008","10009","10010","10011","10023","10026","10049"],"last_name":"McGlaughon","@id":"/users/84a6e93b-5075-4dfb-9de5-a9fcde89abc9/","first_name":"Jen","date_created":"2017-01-05T08:00:00+00:00","user_status":"active","uuid":"84a6e93b-5075-4dfb-9de5-a9fcde89abc9"},"associatedGdm":["/gdm/316ac2fc-555e-4c2e-a0ba-29a7e1663f72/"],"modified_by":"/users/c0a70214-08a8-48a0-ba8d-521bed321d4a/","date_created":"2017-03-02T19:27:42.844426+00:00","number_family":""},{"schema_version":"4","@type":["annotation","item"],"number_individual":"","active":true,"number_group":"","affiliation":"10003","families":[],"status":"in progress","@id":"/evidence/358e284b-c9a1-4d4e-a6dc-92848ef5998e/","groups":[],"uuid":"358e284b-c9a1-4d4e-a6dc-92848ef5998e","individuals":[],"last_modified":"2019-06-28T15:34:03.079404+00:00","number_experimental":1,"experimentalData":[{"rescue":{},"submitted_by":{"title":"Jen McGlaughon","lab":"/labs/curator/","@type":["user","item"],"email":"jennifer.mcglaughon@gmail.com","affiliation":["10003","10008","10009","10010","10011","10023","10026","10049"],"last_name":"McGlaughon","@id":"/users/84a6e93b-5075-4dfb-9de5-a9fcde89abc9/","first_name":"Jen","date_created":"2017-01-05T08:00:00+00:00","user_status":"active","uuid":"84a6e93b-5075-4dfb-9de5-a9fcde89abc9"},"affiliation":"10003","proteinInteractions":{},"@id":"/experimental/a4811a5f-b100-45a5-9a14-d62e4972f95d/","label":"Grossmann Mouse Model","functionalAlteration":{},"uuid":"a4811a5f-b100-45a5-9a14-d62e4972f95d","last_modified":"2019-06-28T15:34:03.089149+00:00","evidenceType":"Model Systems","biochemicalFunction":{"geneWithSameFunctionSameDisease":{},"geneFunctionConsistentWithPhenotype":{"phenotypeHPO":[]}},"schema_version":"8","active":true,"@type":["experimental","item"],"status":"in progress","modelSystems":{"modelSystemsType":"Non-human model organism","phenotypeHPO":"HP:0001627","explanation":"Confocal microscopy showed that unlike in wt hearts, desmoplakin of mutant hearts did not colocalize with junction proteins (plakoglobin, N-cadherin, beta-catenin, desmogelin Dsg2, alpha-catenin, and p120ctn).

Thus, we conclude that plakophilin 2 is important for the assembly of junctional proteins and represents an essential morphogenic factor and architectural component of the heart.","date_created":"2017-03-02T20:00:44.744906+00:00","pmid":"15479741"},"submitted_by":{"title":"Jen McGlaughon","lab":"/labs/curator/","@type":["user","item"],"email":"jennifer.mcglaughon@gmail.com","affiliation":["10003","10008","10009","10010","10011","10023","10026","10049"],"last_name":"McGlaughon","@id":"/users/84a6e93b-5075-4dfb-9de5-a9fcde89abc9/","first_name":"Jen","date_created":"2017-01-05T08:00:00+00:00","user_status":"active","uuid":"84a6e93b-5075-4dfb-9de5-a9fcde89abc9"},"associatedGdm":["/gdm/316ac2fc-555e-4c2e-a0ba-29a7e1663f72/"],"modified_by":"/users/c0a70214-08a8-48a0-ba8d-521bed321d4a/","date_created":"2017-03-02T20:00:44.957145+00:00","number_family":""},{"schema_version":"4","@type":["annotation","item"],"number_individual":"","active":true,"number_group":"","affiliation":"10003","families":[],"status":"in progress","@id":"/evidence/1db12a11-a59b-4c70-8521-4153aff01cb6/","groups":[],"uuid":"1db12a11-a59b-4c70-8521-4153aff01cb6","individuals":[],"last_modified":"2019-06-28T15:34:03.122366+00:00","number_experimental":"","experimentalData":[],"article":{"schema_version":"1","journal":"Heart rhythm","date":"2017 Feb 12.","active":true,"@type":["article","item"],"title":"Cardiac Phenotype and Long Term Prognosis of Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Cardiomyopathy/Dysplasia Patients with Late Presentation.","authors":["Bhonsale A","Te Riele AS","Sawant AC","Groeneweg JA","James CA","Murray B","Tichnell C","Mast TP","van der Pols MJ","Cramer MJ","Dooijes D","van der Heijden JF","Tandri H","van Tintelen JP","Judge DP","Hauer RN","Calkins H"],"@id":"/articles/28215569/","pmcid":"","uuid":"dd0df030-8d88-41b1-bcd4-88dfbde007a5","doi":"","last_modified":"2017-03-03T14:22:18.122675+00:00","submitted_by":{"title":"Jen McGlaughon","lab":"/labs/curator/","@type":["user","item"],"email":"jennifer.mcglaughon@gmail.com","affiliation":["10003","10008","10009","10010","10011","10023","10026","10049"],"last_name":"McGlaughon","@id":"/users/84a6e93b-5075-4dfb-9de5-a9fcde89abc9/","first_name":"Jen","date_created":"2017-01-05T08:00:00+00:00","user_status":"active","uuid":"84a6e93b-5075-4dfb-9de5-a9fcde89abc9"},"abstract":"The clinical profile of Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Cardiomyopathy/ Dysplasia patients with late presentation (ARVC/D) is unknown.","date_created":"2017-03-03T14:22:18.122687+00:00","pmid":"28215569"},"submitted_by":{"title":"Jen McGlaughon","lab":"/labs/curator/","@type":["user","item"],"email":"jennifer.mcglaughon@gmail.com","affiliation":["10003","10008","10009","10010","10011","10023","10026","10049"],"last_name":"McGlaughon","@id":"/users/84a6e93b-5075-4dfb-9de5-a9fcde89abc9/","first_name":"Jen","date_created":"2017-01-05T08:00:00+00:00","user_status":"active","uuid":"84a6e93b-5075-4dfb-9de5-a9fcde89abc9"},"associatedGdm":["/gdm/316ac2fc-555e-4c2e-a0ba-29a7e1663f72/"],"modified_by":"/users/c0a70214-08a8-48a0-ba8d-521bed321d4a/","date_created":"2017-03-03T14:22:18.304449+00:00","number_family":""},{"schema_version":"4","@type":["annotation","item"],"number_individual":"","active":true,"number_group":"","affiliation":"10003","families":[],"status":"in progress","@id":"/evidence/fdb6d3ec-35bb-4f7b-9208-624ef650ccd4/","groups":[],"uuid":"fdb6d3ec-35bb-4f7b-9208-624ef650ccd4","individuals":[],"last_modified":"2019-06-28T15:34:03.136933+00:00","number_experimental":1,"experimentalData":[{"rescue":{},"submitted_by":{"title":"Jen McGlaughon","lab":"/labs/curator/","@type":["user","item"],"email":"jennifer.mcglaughon@gmail.com","affiliation":["10003","10008","10009","10010","10011","10023","10026","10049"],"last_name":"McGlaughon","@id":"/users/84a6e93b-5075-4dfb-9de5-a9fcde89abc9/","first_name":"Jen","date_created":"2017-01-05T08:00:00+00:00","user_status":"active","uuid":"84a6e93b-5075-4dfb-9de5-a9fcde89abc9"},"affiliation":"10003","proteinInteractions":{},"@id":"/experimental/fbc6ad25-7664-4f84-bbdf-b38a4a3b7649/","label":"Hall Functional Alteration","functionalAlteration":{"evidenceInPaper":"Figure 3, 4, 5","descriptionOfGeneAlteration":"Generated a retroviral expression system to express PKP2 mutants (deletion mutation that results in a protein of 544 amino acids and a missense Q62K) in epithelial cells.

Mutations in several desmosomal components including plakophilin-2 have been identified in ARVC patients; however, the molecular interactions disrupted by plakophilin-2 mutations are currently unknown. To understand the pathological basis of ARVC, the authors analyzed desmosome assembly and stability in epithelial cell lines expressing mutants of plakophilin-2 found in ARVC patients. Mutant plakophilin-2 proteins were unable to disrupt established desmosomes when expressed in an E-cadherin-expressing epithelial cell model; however, they were unable to initiate de novo assembly of desmosomes in an N-cadherin-expressing epithelial cell model.

right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) is characterized by life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias and fibrofatty replacement of the cardiac tissue. Desmosomes are prominent cell-cell junctions found in a variety of tissues that resist mechanical stress, including the heart, and recruit the intermediate filament cytoskeleton to sites of cell-cell contact. Mutations in several desmosomal components including plakophilin-2 have been identified in ARVC patients; however, the molecular interactions disrupted by plakophilin-2 mutations are currently unknown. To understand the pathological basis of ARVC, the authors analyzed desmosome assembly and stability in epithelial cell lines expressing mutants of plakophilin-2 found in ARVC patients. Mutant plakophilin-2 proteins were unable to disrupt established desmosomes when expressed in an E-cadherin-expressing epithelial cell model; however, they were unable to initiate de novo assembly of desmosomes in an N-cadherin-expressing epithelial cell model. These studies expand our understanding of desmosome assembly and dynamics.","date_created":"2017-03-03T18:31:26.588005+00:00","pmid":"19533476"},"submitted_by":{"title":"Jen McGlaughon","lab":"/labs/curator/","@type":["user","item"],"email":"jennifer.mcglaughon@gmail.com","affiliation":["10003","10008","10009","10010","10011","10023","10026","10049"],"last_name":"McGlaughon","@id":"/users/84a6e93b-5075-4dfb-9de5-a9fcde89abc9/","first_name":"Jen","date_created":"2017-01-05T08:00:00+00:00","user_status":"active","uuid":"84a6e93b-5075-4dfb-9de5-a9fcde89abc9"},"associatedGdm":["/gdm/316ac2fc-555e-4c2e-a0ba-29a7e1663f72/"],"modified_by":"/users/c0a70214-08a8-48a0-ba8d-521bed321d4a/","date_created":"2017-03-03T18:31:26.736336+00:00","number_family":""},{"schema_version":"4","@type":["annotation","item"],"number_individual":"","active":true,"number_group":"","affiliation":"10003","families":[],"status":"in progress","@id":"/evidence/960f1ea2-697e-4fd6-b424-4ca462f1347c/","groups":[],"uuid":"960f1ea2-697e-4fd6-b424-4ca462f1347c","individuals":[],"last_modified":"2019-06-28T15:34:03.185571+00:00","number_experimental":"","experimentalData":[],"article":{"schema_version":"1","journal":"Heart rhythm","date":"2008 Dec;5(12):1715-23.","active":true,"@type":["article","item"],"title":"Characterization of the molecular phenotype of two arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC)-related plakophilin-2 (PKP2) mutations.","authors":["Joshi-Mukherjee R","Coombs W","Musa H","Oxford E","Taffet S","Delmar M"],"@id":"/articles/19084810/","pmcid":"","uuid":"2e906b54-ee0a-42e8-9fb2-b68a85a98aed","doi":"","last_modified":"2017-03-03T19:19:02.080458+00:00","submitted_by":{"title":"Jen McGlaughon","lab":"/labs/curator/","@type":["user","item"],"email":"jennifer.mcglaughon@gmail.com","affiliation":["10003","10008","10009","10010","10011","10023","10026","10049"],"last_name":"McGlaughon","@id":"/users/84a6e93b-5075-4dfb-9de5-a9fcde89abc9/","first_name":"Jen","date_created":"2017-01-05T08:00:00+00:00","user_status":"active","uuid":"84a6e93b-5075-4dfb-9de5-a9fcde89abc9"},"abstract":"Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) has been linked to mutations in desmosomal proteins, including plakophilin-2 (PKP2).

Among the three known plakophilin members, plakophilin 1 has been linked to a genetic skin disorder and shown to play important roles in desmosome assembly and organization. However, little is known about the binding partners and functions of the most widely expressed member, plakophilin 2. To better understand the cellular functions of plakophilin 2, we have examined its protein interactions with other junctional molecules using co-immunoprecipitation and yeast two-hybrid assays. Here we show that plakophilin 2 can interact directly with several desmosomal components, including desmoplakin, plakoglobin, desmoglein 1 and 2, and desmocollin 1a and 2a. The head domain of plakophilin 2 is critical for most of these interactions and is sufficient to direct plakophilin 2 to cell borders. In addition, plakophilin 2 is less efficient than plakophilin 1 in localizing to the nucleus and enhancing the recruitment of excess desmoplakin to cell borders in transiently transfected COS cells. Furthermore, plakophilin 2 is able to associate with beta-catenin through its head domain, and the expression of plakophilin 2 in SW480 cells up-regulates the endogenous beta-catenin/T cell factor-signaling activity. This up-regulation by plakophilin 2 is abolished by ectopic expression of E-cadherin, suggesting that these proteins compete for the same pool of signaling active beta-catenin. Our results demonstrate that plakophilin 2 interacts with a broader repertoire of desmosomal components than plakophilin 1 and provide new insight into the possible roles of plakophilin 2 in regulating the signaling activity of beta-catenin.","date_created":"2017-03-03T20:04:27.297466+00:00","pmid":"11790773"},"submitted_by":"/users/84a6e93b-5075-4dfb-9de5-a9fcde89abc9/","associatedGdm":[{"modeInheritance":"Autosomal

Among the three known plakophilin members, plakophilin 1 has been linked to a genetic skin disorder and shown to play important roles in desmosome assembly and organization. However, little is known about the binding partners and functions of the most widely expressed member, plakophilin 2. To better understand the cellular functions of plakophilin 2, we have examined its protein interactions with other junctional molecules using co-immunoprecipitation and yeast two-hybrid assays. Here we show that plakophilin 2 can interact directly with several desmosomal components, including desmoplakin, plakoglobin, desmoglein 1 and 2, and desmocollin 1a and 2a. The head domain of plakophilin 2 is critical for most of these interactions and is sufficient to direct plakophilin 2 to cell borders. In addition, plakophilin 2 is less efficient than plakophilin 1 in localizing to the nucleus and enhancing the recruitment of excess desmoplakin to cell borders in transiently transfected COS cells. Furthermore, plakophilin 2 is able to associate with beta-catenin through its head domain, and the expression of plakophilin 2 in SW480 cells up-regulates the endogenous beta-catenin/T cell factor-signaling activity.
