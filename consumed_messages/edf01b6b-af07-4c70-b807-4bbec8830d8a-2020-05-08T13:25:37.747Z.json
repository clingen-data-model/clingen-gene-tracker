dysplasia/cardiomyopathy (ARVD/C) is a disorder characterized by fibrofatty replacement of cardiac myocytes that typically manifests in the right ventricle. It is inherited as an autosomal dominant disease with reduced penetrance, although autosomal recessive forms of the disease also occur. We identified four probands with ARVD/C caused by mutations in DSG2, which encodes desmoglein-2, a component of the cardiac desmosome. No association between mutations in this gene and human disease has been reported elsewhere. One of these probands has compound-heterozygous mutations in DSG2, and the remaining three have isolated heterozygous missense mutations, each disrupting known functional components of desmoglein-2. We report that mutations in DSG2 contribute to the development of ARVD/C.","submitted_by":"/users/84a6e93b-5075-4dfb-9de5-a9fcde89abc9/","date_created":"2017-03-28T18:24:34.576951+00:00","title":"DSG2

dysplasia/cardiomyopathy (ARVD/C) is a disorder characterized by fibrofatty replacement of cardiac myocytes that typically manifests in the right ventricle. It is inherited as an autosomal dominant disease with reduced penetrance, although autosomal recessive forms of the disease also occur. We identified four probands with ARVD/C caused by mutations in DSG2, which encodes desmoglein-2, a component of the cardiac desmosome. No association between mutations in this gene and human disease has been reported elsewhere. One of these probands has compound-heterozygous mutations in DSG2, and the remaining three have isolated heterozygous missense mutations, each disrupting known functional components of desmoglein-2. We report that mutations in DSG2 contribute to the development of ARVD/C.","submitted_by":"/users/84a6e93b-5075-4dfb-9de5-a9fcde89abc9/","date_created":"2017-03-28T18:24:34.576951+00:00","title":"DSG2

dysplasia/cardiomyopathy (ARVD/C) is a disorder characterized by fibrofatty replacement of cardiac myocytes that typically manifests in the right ventricle. It is inherited as an autosomal dominant disease with reduced penetrance, although autosomal recessive forms of the disease also occur. We identified four probands with ARVD/C caused by mutations in DSG2, which encodes desmoglein-2, a component of the cardiac desmosome. No association between mutations in this gene and human disease has been reported elsewhere. One of these probands has compound-heterozygous mutations in DSG2, and the remaining three have isolated heterozygous missense mutations, each disrupting known functional components of desmoglein-2. We report that mutations in DSG2 contribute to the development of ARVD/C.","submitted_by":"/users/84a6e93b-5075-4dfb-9de5-a9fcde89abc9/","date_created":"2017-03-28T18:24:34.576951+00:00","title":"DSG2

dysplasia/cardiomyopathy (ARVD/C) is a disorder characterized by fibrofatty replacement of cardiac myocytes that typically manifests in the right ventricle. It is inherited as an autosomal dominant disease with reduced penetrance, although autosomal recessive forms of the disease also occur. We identified four probands with ARVD/C caused by mutations in DSG2, which encodes desmoglein-2, a component of the cardiac desmosome. No association between mutations in this gene and human disease has been reported elsewhere. One of these probands has compound-heterozygous mutations in DSG2, and the remaining three have isolated heterozygous missense mutations, each disrupting known functional components of desmoglein-2. We report that mutations in DSG2 contribute to the development of ARVD/C.","submitted_by":"/users/84a6e93b-5075-4dfb-9de5-a9fcde89abc9/","date_created":"2017-03-28T18:24:34.576951+00:00","title":"DSG2

heart failure, and sudden death. The most frequent ARVC genes encode desmosomal proteins of which mutations in desmoglein-2 (DSG2), account for 10%-20% of cases. This study aimed to investigate how DSG2 mutations contribute to the pathogenesis of ARVC. Initial mutation analysis of DSG2 in 71 probands identified the first family reported with recessively inherited ARVC due to a missense mutation. In addition, three recognized DSG2 mutations were identified in 12 families. These results and further mutation analyses of four additional desmosomal genes indicated that ARVC caused by DSG2 mutations is often transmitted by recessive or digenic inheritance. Because desmosomal proteins are also expressed in skin tissue, keratinocytes served as a cell model to investigate DSG2 protein expression by Western blotting, 2D-PAGE, and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. The results showed that heterozygous mutation carriers expressed both mutated and wild-type DSG2 proteins. These findings were consistent with the results obtained by immunohistochemistry of endomyocardial biopsies and epidermal tissue of mutation carriers, which indicated a normal cellular distribution of DSG2. The results suggested a dominant-negative effect of the mutated DSG2 proteins because they were incorporated into the desmosomes.","submitted_by":"/users/84a6e93b-5075-4dfb-9de5-a9fcde89abc9/","date_created":"2017-03-28T20:04:26.177299+00:00","title":"Mutated desmoglein-2 proteins are incorporated into desmosomes and

heart failure, and sudden death. The most frequent ARVC genes encode desmosomal proteins of which mutations in desmoglein-2 (DSG2), account for 10%-20% of cases. This study aimed to investigate how DSG2 mutations contribute to the pathogenesis of ARVC. Initial mutation analysis of DSG2 in 71 probands identified the first family reported with recessively inherited ARVC due to a missense mutation. In addition, three recognized DSG2 mutations were identified in 12 families. These results and further mutation analyses of four additional desmosomal genes indicated that ARVC caused by DSG2 mutations is often transmitted by recessive or digenic inheritance. Because desmosomal proteins are also expressed in skin tissue, keratinocytes served as a cell model to investigate DSG2 protein expression by Western blotting, 2D-PAGE, and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. The results showed that heterozygous mutation carriers expressed both mutated and wild-type DSG2 proteins. These findings were consistent with the results obtained by immunohistochemistry of endomyocardial biopsies and epidermal tissue of mutation carriers, which indicated a normal cellular distribution of DSG2. The results suggested a dominant-negative effect of the mutated DSG2 proteins because they were incorporated into the desmosomes.","submitted_by":"/users/84a6e93b-5075-4dfb-9de5-a9fcde89abc9/","date_created":"2017-03-28T20:04:26.177299+00:00","title":"Mutated desmoglein-2 proteins are incorporated into desmosomes and

heart failure, and sudden death. The most frequent ARVC genes encode desmosomal proteins of which mutations in desmoglein-2 (DSG2), account for 10%-20% of cases. This study aimed to investigate how DSG2 mutations contribute to the pathogenesis of ARVC. Initial mutation analysis of DSG2 in 71 probands identified the first family reported with recessively inherited ARVC due to a missense mutation. In addition, three recognized DSG2 mutations were identified in 12 families. These results and further mutation analyses of four additional desmosomal genes indicated that ARVC caused by DSG2 mutations is often transmitted by recessive or digenic inheritance. Because desmosomal proteins are also expressed in skin tissue, keratinocytes served as a cell model to investigate DSG2 protein expression by Western blotting, 2D-PAGE, and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. The results showed that heterozygous mutation carriers expressed both mutated and wild-type DSG2 proteins. These findings were consistent with the results obtained by immunohistochemistry of endomyocardial biopsies and epidermal tissue of mutation carriers, which indicated a normal cellular distribution of DSG2. The results suggested a dominant-negative effect of the mutated DSG2 proteins because they were incorporated into the desmosomes.","submitted_by":"/users/84a6e93b-5075-4dfb-9de5-a9fcde89abc9/","date_created":"2017-03-28T20:04:26.177299+00:00","title":"Mutated desmoglein-2 proteins are incorporated into desmosomes and

heart failure, and sudden death. The most frequent ARVC genes encode desmosomal proteins of which mutations in desmoglein-2 (DSG2), account for 10%-20% of cases. This study aimed to investigate how DSG2 mutations contribute to the pathogenesis of ARVC. Initial mutation analysis of DSG2 in 71 probands identified the first family reported with recessively inherited ARVC due to a missense mutation. In addition, three recognized DSG2 mutations were identified in 12 families. These results and further mutation analyses of four additional desmosomal genes indicated that ARVC caused by DSG2 mutations is often transmitted by recessive or digenic inheritance. Because desmosomal proteins are also expressed in skin tissue, keratinocytes served as a cell model to investigate DSG2 protein expression by Western blotting, 2D-PAGE, and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. The results showed that heterozygous mutation carriers expressed both mutated and wild-type DSG2 proteins. These findings were consistent with the results obtained by immunohistochemistry of endomyocardial biopsies and epidermal tissue of mutation carriers, which indicated a normal cellular distribution of DSG2. The results suggested a dominant-negative effect of the mutated DSG2 proteins because they were incorporated into the desmosomes.","submitted_by":"/users/84a6e93b-5075-4dfb-9de5-a9fcde89abc9/","date_created":"2017-03-28T20:04:26.177299+00:00","title":"Mutated desmoglein-2 proteins are incorporated into desmosomes and

with a diagnosis of sporadic arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC). Genetic screening identified the heterozygous missense mutation R49H in the desmoglein-2 gene. The mutation was absent in both parents, and we demonstrated that it was a de novo mutation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first description of a de novo mutation in ARVC. This has important implications, including for clinical practice, since individuals with sporadic ARVC caused by a de novo mutation can transmit the disease gene to 50% of their offspring. This suggests that the benefit of molecular genetics can be extended to sporadic ARVC and may improve genetic counselling.","submitted_by":"/users/84a6e93b-5075-4dfb-9de5-a9fcde89abc9/","date_created":"2017-03-29T15:17:01.059049+00:00","title":"Sporadic arrhythmogenic right ventricular

with a diagnosis of sporadic arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC). Genetic screening identified the heterozygous missense mutation R49H in the desmoglein-2 gene. The mutation was absent in both parents, and we demonstrated that it was a de novo mutation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first description of a de novo mutation in ARVC. This has important implications, including for clinical practice, since individuals with sporadic ARVC caused by a de novo mutation can transmit the disease gene to 50% of their offspring. This suggests that the benefit of molecular genetics can be extended to sporadic ARVC and may improve genetic counselling.","submitted_by":{"email":"jennifer.mcglaughon@gmail.com","user_status":"active","first_name":"Jen","@id":"/users/84a6e93b-5075-4dfb-9de5-a9fcde89abc9/","title":"Jen McGlaughon","date_created":"2017-01-05T08:00:00+00:00","uuid":"84a6e93b-5075-4dfb-9de5-a9fcde89abc9","lab":"/labs/curator/","last_name":"McGlaughon","affiliation":["10003","10008","10009","10010","10011","10023","10026","10049"],"@type":["user","item"]},"date_created":"2017-03-29T15:17:01.059049+00:00","title":"Sporadic arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy/dysplasia due to a de novo mutation.","active":true,"@type":["article","item"]},"date_created":"2017-03-29T15:17:01.184361+00:00","experimentalData":[],"groups":[],"number_family":"","uuid":"093e8c35-1427-45d8-8782-aa1abc70ab49","status":"in progress"},{"modified_by":"/users/c0a70214-08a8-48a0-ba8d-521bed321d4a/","families":[],"active":true,"@id":"/evidence/4c67166b-b5ef-4e32-a173-7658faf771d5/","submitted_by":{"email":"jennifer.mcglaughon@gmail.com","user_status":"active","first_name":"Jen","@id":"/users/84a6e93b-5075-4dfb-9de5-a9fcde89abc9/","title":"Jen McGlaughon","date_created":"2017-01-05T08:00:00+00:00","uuid":"84a6e93b-5075-4dfb-9de5-a9fcde89abc9","lab":"/labs/curator/","last_name":"McGlaughon","affiliation":["10003","10008","10009","10010","10011","10023","10026","10049"],"@type":["user","item"]},"schema_version":"4","affiliation":"10003","number_experimental":"","number_group":1,"last_modified":"2019-06-28T15:35:49.400909+00:00","individuals":[],"associatedGdm":["/gdm/d2fa9cc8-f00e-40a5-9e4f-eb145cf8e2ed/"],"@type":["annotation","item"],"number_individual":"","article":{"date":"2007 Mar;28(5):581-8.","journal":"European heart journal","@id":"/articles/17105751/","last_modified":"2017-03-29T15:55:23.866621+00:00","uuid":"abc11416-95a1-4bdc-89b6-e1506a93d8dd","doi":"","authors":["Syrris P","Ward D","Asimaki A","Evans A","Sen-Chowdhry S","Hughes SE","McKenna WJ"],"pmcid":"","schema_version":"1","pmid":"17105751","abstract":"Mutations in the desmoglein-2 (DSG2) gene have been reported in patients with arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) but clinical information regarding the associated phenotype is at present limited.

WW"],"pmcid":"","schema_version":"1","pmid":"8143788","abstract":"Desmosomes are junctions between epithelial, myocardiac, and certain other kinds of cells. They represent plasma membrane domains enriched in specific transmembrane glycoproteins, notably desmoglein (Dsg) and desmocollin (Dsc), both of which have recently been identified as members of the larger family of Ca(2+)-dependent cell adhesion molecules, the cadherins. Previously described forms of desmoglein have been isolated as proteins and cloned as cDNAs from epidermis and related stratified epithelia but have not been detected in the majority of other desmosome-containing tissues and cell culture lines. Here we present the complete cDNA-derived amino acid (aa) sequence of a different desmoglein polypeptide, termed Dsg2 (1069 aa, mol wt 116,760) and its precursor molecule (1117 aa, mol wt 122,384), which occurs in all human and bovine desmosome-producing tissues, tumors, and cell lines examined, epithelial as well as nonepithelial ones. We conclude that Dsg2, the largest molecule in this protein family, is the fundamental desmoglein common to all desmosome-possessing tissues, including simple epithelia and myocardium, and many cell cultures. Furthermore, in several tissues and cell lines Dsg2 is the only Dsg isoform detected so far. By contrast, the epidermal isoforms Dsg1 and Dsg3 are restricted to certain specialized epithelia, mostly stratified squamous ones. The importance of the junction-specific cadherin Dsg2 in tissue formation and carcinogenesis as well as in the development of autoimmune diseases of the Pemphigus type is discussed. In addition, we propose to use Dsg2 as a general marker common to all epithelial cells and tumors and to use the specific pattern of occurrence of Dsg and Dsc isoforms as an additional criterion for cell typing in tumor diagnosis.","submitted_by":{"email":"jennifer.mcglaughon@gmail.com","user_status":"active","first_name":"Jen","@id":"/users/84a6e93b-5075-4dfb-9de5-a9fcde89abc9/","title":"Jen

They represent plasma membrane domains enriched in specific transmembrane glycoproteins, notably desmoglein (Dsg) and desmocollin (Dsc), both of which have recently been identified as members of the larger family of Ca(2+)-dependent cell adhesion molecules, the cadherins. Previously described forms of desmoglein have been isolated as proteins and cloned as cDNAs from epidermis and related stratified epithelia but have not been detected in the majority of other desmosome-containing tissues and cell culture lines. Here we present the complete cDNA-derived amino acid (aa) sequence of a different desmoglein polypeptide, termed Dsg2 (1069 aa, mol wt 116,760) and its precursor molecule (1117 aa, mol wt 122,384), which occurs in all human and bovine desmosome-producing tissues, tumors, and cell lines examined, epithelial as well as nonepithelial ones. We conclude that Dsg2, the largest molecule in this protein family, is the fundamental desmoglein common to all desmosome-possessing tissues, including simple epithelia and myocardium, and many cell cultures. Furthermore, in several tissues and cell lines Dsg2 is the only Dsg isoform detected so far. By contrast, the epidermal isoforms Dsg1 and Dsg3 are restricted to certain specialized epithelia, mostly stratified squamous ones. The importance of the junction-specific cadherin Dsg2 in tissue formation and carcinogenesis as well as in the development of autoimmune diseases of the Pemphigus type is discussed. In addition, we propose to use Dsg2 as a general marker common to all epithelial cells and tumors and to use the specific pattern of occurrence of Dsg and Dsc isoforms as an additional criterion for cell typing in tumor diagnosis.","submitted_by":"/users/84a6e93b-5075-4dfb-9de5-a9fcde89abc9/","date_created":"2017-03-30T16:10:07.697531+00:00","title":"Identification of the ubiquitous human desmoglein, Dsg2, and the expression catalogue of the desmoglein subfamily of desmosomal cadherins.","active":true,"@type":["article","item"]},"date_created":"2017-03-30T16:10:07.860109+00:00","experimentalData":["/experimental/0e143633-22c9-4b77-9a05-c924ec347841/"],"groups":[],"number_family":"","uuid":"1b4e83b0-0633-4134-8b6a-05c03bcec622","status":"in progress"}],"assessments":[],"rescue":{},"schema_version":"8","modelSystems":{},"evidenceType":"Expression","modified_by":{"email":"wrightmw@stanford.edu","user_status":"active","first_name":"Matt","@id":"/users/c0a70214-08a8-48a0-ba8d-521bed321d4a/","title":"Matt Wright","date_created":"2016-11-04T07:00:00+00:00","uuid":"c0a70214-08a8-48a0-ba8d-521bed321d4a","lab":"/labs/curator/","last_name":"Wright","affiliation":["10006","10005","10009","10011","10018","10019","10007","10034","10048","10049","10003","10042","10021","10012","10013","10014","10057","10058","10059","10060","10061","10062","10015","10023","10016","10008","10026"],"@type":["user","item"]},"submitted_by":{"email":"jennifer.mcglaughon@gmail.com","user_status":"active","first_name":"Jen","@id":"/users/84a6e93b-5075-4dfb-9de5-a9fcde89abc9/","title":"Jen McGlaughon","date_created":"2017-01-05T08:00:00+00:00","uuid":"84a6e93b-5075-4dfb-9de5-a9fcde89abc9","lab":"/labs/curator/","last_name":"McGlaughon","affiliation":["10003","10008","10009","10010","10011","10023","10026","10049"],"@type":["user","item"]},"active":true,"@type":["experimental","item"],"proteinInteractions":{},"functionalAlteration":{},"@id":"/experimental/0e143633-22c9-4b77-9a05-c924ec347841/","label":"Myocardium Expression","last_modified":"2019-06-28T15:35:49.517350+00:00","date_created":"2017-03-30T16:15:22.016511+00:00","expression":{"alteredExpression":{},"normalExpression":{"evidenceInPaper":"Figure 4, Table 2","expressedInTissue":true,"evidence":"Using both human and bovine tissue, an RNase protection assay detected DSG2 in multiple tissues, including myocardium.

We studied the explanted heart of a proband carrying the DSG2-N266S mutation as well as transgenic mice (Tg-NS) with cardiac overexpression of the mouse equivalent of this mutation, N271S-dsg2, with the aim of investigating the pathophysiological mechanisms involved. Transgenic mice recapitulated the clinical features of ARVC, including sudden death at young age, spontaneous ventricular arrhythmias, cardiac dysfunction, and biventricular dilatation and aneurysms. Investigation of transgenic lines with different levels of transgene expression attested to a dose-dependent dominant-negative effect of the mutation. We demonstrate for the first time that myocyte necrosis is the key initiator of myocardial injury, triggering progressive myocardial damage, including an inflammatory response and massive calcification within the myocardium, followed by injury repair with fibrous tissue replacement, and myocardial atrophy. These observations were supported by findings in the explanted heart from the patient. Insight into mechanisms initiating myocardial damage in ARVC is a prerequisite to the future development of new therapies aimed at delaying onset or progression of the disease.","submitted_by":{"email":"jennifer.mcglaughon@gmail.com","user_status":"active","first_name":"Jen","@id":"/users/84a6e93b-5075-4dfb-9de5-a9fcde89abc9/","title":"Jen McGlaughon","date_created":"2017-01-05T08:00:00+00:00","uuid":"84a6e93b-5075-4dfb-9de5-a9fcde89abc9","lab":"/labs/curator/","last_name":"McGlaughon","affiliation":["10003","10008","10009","10010","10011","10023","10026","10049"],"@type":["user","item"]},"date_created":"2017-03-30T17:40:17.427293+00:00","title":"Myocyte necrosis underlies progressive myocardial dystrophy in mouse dsg2-related arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy.","active":true,"@type":["article","item"]},"date_created":"2017-03-30T17:40:17.590394+00:00","experimentalData":[{"scores":[{"evidenceScored":"41bc52f6-34e9-4c55-b55b-8d68083ebf1e","caseControl_scored":[],"score":1.5,"@id":"/evidencescore/9adcbef7-5361-4e45-8749-fd3d3d4224e6/","last_modified":"2019-06-28T15:35:49.657181+00:00","submitted_by":{"email":"jennifer.mcglaughon@gmail.com","user_status":"active","first_name":"Jen","@id":"/users/84a6e93b-5075-4dfb-9de5-a9fcde89abc9/","title":"Jen McGlaughon","date_created":"2017-01-05T08:00:00+00:00","uuid":"84a6e93b-5075-4dfb-9de5-a9fcde89abc9","lab":"/labs/curator/","last_name":"McGlaughon","affiliation":["10003","10008","10009","10010","10011","10023","10026","10049"],"@type":["user","item"]},"schema_version":"2","individual_scored":[],"@type":["evidenceScore","item"],"evidenceType":"Experimental","modified_by":{"email":"wrightmw@stanford.edu","user_status":"active","first_name":"Matt","@id":"/users/c0a70214-08a8-48a0-ba8d-521bed321d4a/","title":"Matt Wright","date_created":"2016-11-04T07:00:00+00:00","uuid":"c0a70214-08a8-48a0-ba8d-521bed321d4a","lab":"/labs/curator/","last_name":"Wright","affiliation":["10006","10005","10009","10011","10018","10019","10007","10034","10048","10049","10003","10042","10021","10012","10013","10014","10057","10058","10059","10060","10061","10062","10015","10023","10016","10008","10026"],"@type":["user","item"]},"experimental_scored":["/experimental/41bc52f6-34e9-4c55-b55b-8d68083ebf1e/"],"date_created":"2017-03-31T14:50:03.090401+00:00","calculatedScore":2,"scoreStatus":"Score","scoreExplanation":"The lower expressing transgenic mouse line also recapitulated some of the phenotypes, but at a slower rate, so there seems to be a dose-dependent, dominant negative effect.

Transgenic mice recapitulated the clinical features of ARVC, including sudden death at young age, spontaneous ventricular arrhythmias, cardiac dysfunction, and biventricular dilatation and aneurysms. Investigation of transgenic lines with different levels of transgene expression attested to a dose-dependent dominant-negative effect of the mutation. We demonstrate for the first time that myocyte necrosis is the key initiator of myocardial injury, triggering progressive myocardial damage, including an inflammatory response and massive calcification within the myocardium, followed by injury repair with fibrous tissue replacement, and myocardial atrophy. These observations were supported by findings in the explanted heart from the patient. Insight into mechanisms initiating myocardial damage in ARVC is a prerequisite to the future development of new therapies aimed at delaying onset or progression of the disease.","submitted_by":"/users/84a6e93b-5075-4dfb-9de5-a9fcde89abc9/","date_created":"2017-03-30T17:40:17.427293+00:00","title":"Myocyte necrosis underlies progressive myocardial dystrophy in mouse dsg2-related arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy.","active":true,"@type":["article","item"]},"date_created":"2017-03-30T17:40:17.590394+00:00","experimentalData":["/experimental/41bc52f6-34e9-4c55-b55b-8d68083ebf1e/"],"groups":[],"number_family":"","uuid":"d69bf848-51ed-4f90-ab94-e1ac7d712bb0","status":"in progress"}],"assessments":[],"rescue":{},"schema_version":"8","modelSystems":{"phenotypeHPO":"HP:0001699, HP:0004756, HP:0002119, HP:0006698","descriptionOfGeneAlteration":"Generated transgenic mice with cardiac-specific overexpression of FLAG-tagged wile-type dsg2 and N271S dsg2 (human N266S).

Among the three known plakophilin members, plakophilin 1 has been linked to a genetic skin disorder and shown to play important roles in desmosome assembly and organization. However, little is known about the binding partners and functions of the most widely expressed member, plakophilin 2. To better understand the cellular functions of plakophilin 2, we have examined its protein interactions with other junctional molecules using co-immunoprecipitation and yeast two-hybrid assays. Here we show that plakophilin 2 can interact directly with several desmosomal components, including desmoplakin, plakoglobin, desmoglein 1 and 2, and desmocollin 1a and 2a. The head domain of plakophilin 2 is critical for most of these interactions and is sufficient to direct plakophilin 2 to cell borders. In addition, plakophilin 2 is less efficient than plakophilin 1 in localizing to the nucleus and enhancing the recruitment of excess desmoplakin to cell borders in transiently transfected COS cells. Furthermore, plakophilin 2 is able to associate with beta-catenin through its head domain, and the expression of plakophilin 2 in SW480 cells up-regulates the endogenous beta-catenin/T cell factor-signaling activity. This up-regulation by plakophilin 2 is abolished by ectopic expression of E-cadherin, suggesting that these proteins compete for the same pool of signaling active beta-catenin. Our results demonstrate that plakophilin 2 interacts with a broader repertoire of desmosomal components than plakophilin 1 and provide new insight into the possible roles of plakophilin 2 in regulating the signaling activity of beta-catenin.","submitted_by":{"email":"jennifer.mcglaughon@gmail.com","user_status":"active","first_name":"Jen","@id":"/users/84a6e93b-5075-4dfb-9de5-a9fcde89abc9/","title":"Jen McGlaughon","date_created":"2017-01-05T08:00:00+00:00","uuid":"84a6e93b-5075-4dfb-9de5-a9fcde89abc9","lab":"/labs/curator/","last_name":"McGlaughon","affiliation":["10003","10008","10009","10010","10011","10023","10026","10049"],"@type":["user","item"]},"date_created":"2017-03-03T20:04:27.297466+00:00","title":"Protein binding and functional characterization of plakophilin 2.

Among the three known plakophilin members, plakophilin 1 has been linked to a genetic skin disorder and shown to play important roles in desmosome assembly and organization. However, little is known about the binding partners and functions of the most widely expressed member, plakophilin 2. To better understand the cellular functions of plakophilin 2, we have examined its protein interactions with other junctional molecules using co-immunoprecipitation and yeast two-hybrid assays. Here we show that plakophilin 2 can interact directly with several desmosomal components, including desmoplakin, plakoglobin, desmoglein 1 and 2, and desmocollin 1a and 2a. The head domain of plakophilin 2 is critical for most of these interactions and is sufficient to direct plakophilin 2 to cell borders. In addition, plakophilin 2 is less efficient than plakophilin 1 in localizing to the nucleus and enhancing the recruitment of excess desmoplakin to cell borders in transiently transfected COS cells. Furthermore, plakophilin 2 is able to associate with beta-catenin through its head domain, and the expression of plakophilin 2 in SW480 cells up-regulates the endogenous beta-catenin/T cell factor-signaling activity. This up-regulation by plakophilin 2 is abolished by ectopic expression of E-cadherin, suggesting that these proteins compete for the same pool of signaling active beta-catenin. Our results demonstrate that plakophilin 2 interacts with a broader repertoire of desmosomal components than plakophilin 1 and provide new insight into the possible roles of plakophilin 2 in regulating the signaling activity of beta-catenin.","submitted_by":"/users/84a6e93b-5075-4dfb-9de5-a9fcde89abc9/","date_created":"2017-03-03T20:04:27.297466+00:00","title":"Protein binding and functional characterization of plakophilin 2.

The incorporation of cadherins, catenin adaptors, and cytoskeletal elements resembles the closely related adherens junction. However, the recruitment of intermediate filaments distinguishes desmosomes and imparts a unique function. By linking the load-bearing intermediate filaments of neighboring cells, desmosomes create mechanically contiguous cell sheets and, in so doing, confer structural integrity to the tissues they populate. This trait and a well-established role in human disease have long captured the attention of cell biologists, as evidenced by a publication record dating back to the mid-1860s. Likewise, emerging data implicating the desmosome in signaling events pertinent to organismal development, carcinogenesis, and genetic disorders will secure a prominent role for desmosomes in future biological and biomedical investigations.","submitted_by":{"email":"jennifer.mcglaughon@gmail.com","user_status":"active","first_name":"Jen","@id":"/users/84a6e93b-5075-4dfb-9de5-a9fcde89abc9/","title":"Jen McGlaughon","date_created":"2017-01-05T08:00:00+00:00","uuid":"84a6e93b-5075-4dfb-9de5-a9fcde89abc9","lab":"/labs/curator/","last_name":"McGlaughon","affiliation":["10003","10008","10009","10010","10011","10023","10026","10049"],"@type":["user","item"]},"date_created":"2017-03-31T15:30:54.342566+00:00","title":"Structural and functional diversity of desmosomes.","active":true,"@type":["article","item"]},"date_created":"2017-03-31T15:30:54.480261+00:00","experimentalData":[{"scores":[{"calculatedScore":0.5,"caseControl_scored":[],"score":1,"@id":"/evidencescore/ed4b0e64-65a1-4701-a2e3-d6fd4404ff17/","last_modified":"2019-06-28T15:35:49.821038+00:00","submitted_by":{"email":"jennifer.mcglaughon@gmail.com","user_status":"active","first_name":"Jen","@id":"/users/84a6e93b-5075-4dfb-9de5-a9fcde89abc9/","title":"Jen McGlaughon","date_created":"2017-01-05T08:00:00+00:00","uuid":"84a6e93b-5075-4dfb-9de5-a9fcde89abc9","lab":"/labs/curator/","last_name":"McGlaughon","affiliation":["10003","10008","10009","10010","10011","10023","10026","10049"],"@type":["user","item"]},"schema_version":"2","individual_scored":[],"evidenceType":"Experimental","modified_by":{"email":"wrightmw@stanford.edu","user_status":"active","first_name":"Matt","@id":"/users/c0a70214-08a8-48a0-ba8d-521bed321d4a/","title":"Matt Wright","date_created":"2016-11-04T07:00:00+00:00","uuid":"c0a70214-08a8-48a0-ba8d-521bed321d4a","lab":"/labs/curator/","last_name":"Wright","affiliation":["10006","10005","10009","10011","10018","10019","10007","10034","10048","10049","10003","10042","10021","10012","10013","10014","10057","10058","10059","10060","10061","10062","10015","10023","10016","10008","10026"],"@type":["user","item"]},"experimental_scored":["/experimental/fdf73cf8-8faa-41b8-8c38-bcad250fbe53/"],"date_created":"2017-03-31T15:51:14.190111+00:00","affiliation":"10003","scoreStatus":"Score","scoreExplanation":"Increased due to the well-established structure/function of desmosomes and the role of the desmosome genes as the primary cause of ARVC.","uuid":"ed4b0e64-65a1-4701-a2e3-d6fd4404ff17","@type":["evidenceScore","item"],"status":"in progress"}],"biochemicalFunction":{"evidenceForFunction":"DSG2, along with DSC2, PKP2, JUP and DSP are known to make up desmosomes, which are intercellular junctions of epithelia and cardiac muscle.

cells. The incorporation of cadherins, catenin adaptors, and cytoskeletal elements resembles the closely related adherens junction. However, the recruitment of intermediate filaments distinguishes desmosomes and imparts a unique function. By linking the load-bearing intermediate filaments of neighboring cells, desmosomes create mechanically contiguous cell sheets and, in so doing, confer structural integrity to the tissues they populate. This trait and a well-established role in human disease have long captured the attention of cell biologists, as evidenced by a publication record dating back to the mid-1860s. Likewise, emerging data implicating the desmosome in signaling events pertinent to organismal development, carcinogenesis, and genetic disorders will secure a prominent role for desmosomes in future biological and biomedical investigations.","submitted_by":"/users/84a6e93b-5075-4dfb-9de5-a9fcde89abc9/","date_created":"2017-03-31T15:30:54.342566+00:00","title":"Structural and functional diversity

Variants in DSG2 were first reported in humans with this disease as early as 2006 (Pilchou et al., PMID: 16505173). Variation in DSG2 is a well-known cause of ARVC and accounts for 5%-26% of cases (McNAlly et al., 2005; PMID: 20301310). Since this gene-disease relationship is well-known, there is a significant amount of case-level data, segregation data and experimental data available in the literature, therefore the maximum score for both genetic evidence and experimental evidence has been reached.  Note, this curation effort may not be exhaustive of all literature related to this gene-disease relationship. This gene-disease relationship is supported by animal models, in vitro assays, expression assays, and protein interactions. In summary, DSG2 is definitively associated with autosomal dominant ARVC. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Arrythmogenic Right Ventricular Cardiomyopathy Gene Curation Expert Panel on September 14, 2018 (SOP Version 6).","active":true,"alteredClassification":"No Modification","sopVersion":"7","uuid":"f679611d-6e25-45f9-aac3-4a8ad37b1592","schema_version":"11","contradictingEvidence":{"proband":false,"caseControl":false,"experimental":false},"publishClassification":true,"classificationStatus":"Approved","modified_by":"/users/de63cd49-ce44-4514-8222-91145761f157/","submitted_by":"/users/84a6e93b-5075-4dfb-9de5-a9fcde89abc9/","additionalApprover":"","approvedClassification":true,"publishSubmitter":"Courtney Thaxton","classificationPoints":{"geneticEvidenceTotal":12,"function":{"biochemicalFunctions":{"evidenceCount":1,"totalPointsGiven":1},"expression":{"evidenceCount":1,"totalPointsGiven":0.5},"totalPointsGiven":2,"pointsCounted":2,"proteinInteractions":{"evidenceCount":1,"totalPointsGiven":0.5}},"experimentalEvidenceTotal":6,"autosomalDominantOrXlinkedDisorder":{"probandWithOtherVariantTypeWithGeneImpact":{"evidenceCount":10,"pointsCounted":2.3,"totalPointsGiven":2.3},"variantIsDeNovo":{"evidenceCount":1,"pointsCounted":2,"totalPointsGiven":2},"probandWithPredictedOrProvenNullVariant":{"evidenceCount":6,"pointsCounted":8,"totalPointsGiven":8}},"functionalAlteration":{"patientCells":{"evidenceCount":0,"totalPointsGiven":0},"totalPointsGiven":0,"pointsCounted":0,"nonPatientCells":{"evidenceCount":0,"totalPointsGiven":0}},"evidencePointsTotal":18,"segregation":{"evidenceCountTotal":0,"evidenceCountExome":0,"evidencePointsExome":0,"pointsCounted":0,"evidencePointsCandidate":0,"totalPointsGiven":0,"evidenceCountCandidate":0},"modelsRescue":{"rescueNonHuman":{"evidenceCount":0,"totalPointsGiven":0},"rescueCellCulture":{"evidenceCount":0,"totalPointsGiven":0},"modelsCellCulture":{"evidenceCount":0,"totalPointsGiven":0},"pointsCounted":4,"rescueHuman":{"evidenceCount":0,"totalPointsGiven":0},"rescuePatientCells":{"evidenceCount":0,"totalPointsGiven":0},"totalPointsGiven":4,"modelsNonHuman":{"evidenceCount":3,"totalPointsGiven":4}},"autosomalRecessiveDisorder":{"twoVariantsInTransWithOneDeNovo":{"evidenceCount":0,"totalPointsGiven":0},"twoVariantsWithGeneImpactInTrans":{"evidenceCount":0,"totalPointsGiven":0},"pointsCounted":0},"caseControl":{"evidenceCount":0,"pointsCounted":0,"totalPointsGiven":0}},"classificationDate":"2019-08-06T13:14:57.746Z","classificationApprover":"Cindy James","publishAffiliation":"40003","approvalDate":"2020-05-08T13:25:12.343Z","@type":["provisionalClassification","item"],"autoClassification":"Definitive","@id":"/provisional/f679611d-6e25-45f9-aac3-4a8ad37b1592/","approvalReviewDate":"2018-09-14T16:00:00.000Z","last_modified":"2020-05-08T13:25:37.747+00:00","replicatedOverTime":true,"contributorComment":"The UNC Biocuration Core curated and published this gene-disease relationship as part of a initiative to curate the ACMG59 genes.
