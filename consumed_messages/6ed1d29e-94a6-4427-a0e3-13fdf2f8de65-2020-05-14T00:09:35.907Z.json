This study indicates that mutations of the gene encoding neutrophil elastase are probably the most common cause for severe congenital neutropenia as well as the cause for sporadic and autosomal dominant cyclic neutropenia.","date":"2000 Oct 1;96(7):2317-22.","date_created":"2020-02-01T14:39:12.442887+00:00","journal":"Blood","doi":""}}],"sex":"Female","diagnosis":[{"submitted_by":"/users/620abd6f-1e33-41be-9698-41c50e0661de/","associatedFamilies":["/families/ccbd1f70-a52b-4e3e-9e2c-5c0956b00801/","/families/27e0f95e-1b0f-4887-9203-231c406a7249/"],"term":"neutropenia","associatedGroups":[],"uuid":"83de1d1f-8708-43d0-9c8c-4679f92360d6","associatedInterpretations":[],"@type":["disease","item"],"associatedIndividuals":["/individuals/81b33546-7bd6-4edf-8361-fcf0cdd4d6da/","/individuals/c16d4d11-9e98-4915-a4e8-436eabbae3a2/","/individuals/cc35d0f8-eb62-4835-bc6d-4835c2d486eb/","/individuals/f35c7f53-e8e0-42e0-ad56-a960a705c285/","/individuals/f4c1a353-6e14-4813-83cd-9185339f0670/","/individuals/487ecdc4-a557-4e56-8665-5d661362f702/","/individuals/fbd29295-2c32-4fbf-ba56-fe92de091fd9/"],"@id":"/diseases/83de1d1f-8708-43d0-9c8c-4679f92360d6/","diseaseId":"MONDO_0001475","synonyms":[],"last_modified":"2020-01-17T20:11:06.557434+00:00","modified_by":"/users/620abd6f-1e33-41be-9698-41c50e0661de/","phenotypes":[],"status":"in progress","date_created":"2020-01-17T20:11:06.557444+00:00","associatedGdm":["/gdm/e8b35a4e-b551-491e-a46b-dd408dad26f5/"],"description":"","schema_version":"2"}],"proband":true,"modified_by":{"uuid":"620abd6f-1e33-41be-9698-41c50e0661de","user_status":"active","@type":["user","item"],"last_name":"Wei","email":"sainan.wei@uky.edu","first_name":"Sainan","date_created":"2018-10-26T07:00:00+00:00","lab":"/labs/curator/","affiliation":["10014","10023"],"title":"Sainan Wei","@id":"/users/620abd6f-1e33-41be-9698-41c50e0661de/"},"hpoIdInDiagnosis":["Neutropenia (HP:0001875)"],"is_proband":"Yes","hpoIdInElimination":["Neutropenia (HP:0001875)"]},{"ageType":"Diagnosis","associatedGroups":[],"@type":["individual","item"],"label":"Patient 4","ageValue":3,"active":true,"uuid":"f4c1a353-6e14-4813-83cd-9185339f0670","scores":[{"submitted_by":{"uuid":"620abd6f-1e33-41be-9698-41c50e0661de","user_status":"active","@type":["user","item"],"last_name":"Wei","email":"sainan.wei@uky.edu","first_name":"Sainan","date_created":"2018-10-26T07:00:00+00:00","lab":"/labs/curator/","affiliation":["10014","10023"],"title":"Sainan Wei","@id":"/users/620abd6f-1e33-41be-9698-41c50e0661de/"},"scoreStatus":"Score","@type":["evidenceScore","item"],"caseControl_scored":[],"evidenceType":"Individual","uuid":"1de6d9a8-d87f-489c-8089-b1d1940db9d5","caseInfoType":"OTHER_VARIANT_TYPE_WITH_GENE_IMPACT","affiliation":"10023","score":1.5,"scoreExplanation":"This is patient 4 (female of 3 yr congenital neutropenia) had a missense variant in exon 3 of ELANE gene NM_001972.4(ELANE):c.214G>A (p.Val72Met).

One individual with congenital neutropenia and 2 other unrelated cyclic neutropenia cases in this cohort had this variant. RT-PCR analysis using cells from bone marrow samples demonstrated altered RNA splicing. Two families with autosomal dominant inheritance cyclic neutropenia and a sporadic case with cyclic neutropenia (Horwitz M et al. 1999. 10581030) also had this variant. Tis variant defines a surface loop, conserved among all serine proteases, responsible for substrate specificity. Engineered mutations within this loop convert trypsin into a derivative with elastase activity. The V161\u2013F170 loop also interfaces with serpins. The pathogenic splicing variants in this gene are mainly in intron 4 at +1. +3 or +5. RT-PCR on patients\u2019 bone marrow confirmed all had altered splicing. Same explanation as the previous mutation in exon 4 in this article. This variant causes dominant negative inhibition.","@id":"/evidencescore/2f0a116c-2019-4cb6-b2d3-32b89b7d0db2/","schema_version":"2","individual_scored":["/individuals/81b33546-7bd6-4edf-8361-fcf0cdd4d6da/"],"last_modified":"2020-04-22T18:26:53.640596+00:00","evidenceScored":"81b33546-7bd6-4edf-8361-fcf0cdd4d6da","modified_by":{"uuid":"620abd6f-1e33-41be-9698-41c50e0661de","user_status":"active","@type":["user","item"],"last_name":"Wei","email":"sainan.wei@uky.edu","first_name":"Sainan","date_created":"2018-10-26T07:00:00+00:00","lab":"/labs/curator/","affiliation":["10014","10023"],"title":"Sainan Wei","@id":"/users/620abd6f-1e33-41be-9698-41c50e0661de/"},"status":"in progress","date_created":"2020-04-22T18:26:53.640426+00:00","experimental_scored":[],"calculatedScore":0.5}],"ageUnit":"Years","assessment_count":0,"@id":"/individuals/81b33546-7bd6-4edf-8361-fcf0cdd4d6da/","schema_version":"7","last_modified":"2020-04-22T18:26:53.781182+00:00","otherPMIDs":[{"submitted_by":{"uuid":"620abd6f-1e33-41be-9698-41c50e0661de","user_status":"active","@type":["user","item"],"last_name":"Wei","email":"sainan.wei@uky.edu","first_name":"Sainan","date_created":"2018-10-26T07:00:00+00:00","lab":"/labs/curator/","affiliation":["10014","10023"],"title":"Sainan Wei","@id":"/users/620abd6f-1e33-41be-9698-41c50e0661de/"},"@type":["article","item"],"active":true,"uuid":"e1fb75bc-e153-4e3a-8530-d531c3529d84","pmcid":"","authors":["Horwitz M","Benson KF","Person RE","Aprikyan AG","Dale DC"],"pmid":"10581030","@id":"/articles/10581030/","schema_version":"1","last_modified":"2020-02-01T20:51:56.344849+00:00","modified_by":"/users/620abd6f-1e33-41be-9698-41c50e0661de/","title":"Mutations in ELA2, encoding neutrophil elastase, define a 21-day biological clock in cyclic haematopoiesis.","abstract":"Human cyclic haematopoiesis (cyclic neutropenia, MIM 162800) is an autosomal dominant disease in which blood-cell production from the bone marrow oscillates with 21-day periodicity. Circulating neutrophils vary between almost normal numbers and zero. During intervals of neutropenia, affected individuals are at risk for opportunistic infection. Monocytes, platelets, lymphocytes and reticulocytes also cycle with the same frequency. Here we use a genome-wide screen and positional cloning to map the locus to chromosome 19p13.3. We identified 7 different single-base substitutions in the gene (ELA2) encoding neutrophil elastase (EC 3. 4.21.37, also known as leukocyte elastase, elastase 2 and medullasin), a serine protease of neutrophil and monocyte granules, on unique haplotypes in 13 of 13 families as well as a new mutation in a sporadic case. Neutrophil elastase (a 240-aa mature protein predominantly found in neutrophil granules) is the target for protease inhibition by alpha1-antitrypsin, and its unopposed release destroys tissue at sites of inflammation. We hypothesize that a perturbed interaction between neutrophil elastase and serpins or other substrates may regulate mechanisms governing the clock-like timing of haematopoiesis.","date":"1999 Dec;23(4):433-6.","date_created":"2020-02-01T20:51:56.344617+00:00","journal":"Nature genetics","doi":""},{"submitted_by":{"uuid":"620abd6f-1e33-41be-9698-41c50e0661de","user_status":"active","@type":["user","item"],"last_name":"Wei","email":"sainan.wei@uky.edu","first_name":"Sainan","date_created":"2018-10-26T07:00:00+00:00","lab":"/labs/curator/","affiliation":["10014","10023"],"title":"Sainan Wei","@id":"/users/620abd6f-1e33-41be-9698-41c50e0661de/"},"@type":["article","item"],"active":true,"uuid":"d26d9bcb-c845-40ad-a80d-81749af06785","pmcid":"","authors":["Dale DC","Person RE","Bolyard AA","Aprikyan AG","Bos C","Bonilla MA","Boxer LA","Kannourakis G","Zeidler C","Welte K","Benson KF","Horwitz M"],"pmid":"11001877","@id":"/articles/11001877/","schema_version":"1","last_modified":"2020-02-01T14:39:12.443113+00:00","modified_by":"/users/620abd6f-1e33-41be-9698-41c50e0661de/","title":"Mutations in the gene encoding neutrophil elastase in congenital and cyclic neutropenia.","abstract":"Congenital neutropenia and cyclic neutropenia are disorders of neutrophil production predisposing patients to recurrent bacterial infections.

in ELA2, encoding neutrophil elastase, define a 21-day biological clock in cyclic haematopoiesis.","abstract":"Human cyclic haematopoiesis (cyclic neutropenia, MIM 162800) is an autosomal dominant disease in which blood-cell production from the bone marrow oscillates with 21-day periodicity. Circulating neutrophils vary between almost normal numbers and zero. During intervals of neutropenia, affected individuals are at risk for opportunistic infection. Monocytes, platelets, lymphocytes and reticulocytes also cycle with the same frequency. Here we use a genome-wide screen and positional cloning to map the locus to chromosome 19p13.3. We identified 7 different single-base substitutions in the gene (ELA2) encoding neutrophil elastase (EC 3. 4.21.37, also known as leukocyte elastase, elastase 2 and medullasin), a serine protease of neutrophil and monocyte granules, on unique haplotypes in 13 of 13 families as well as a new mutation in a sporadic case. Neutrophil elastase (a 240-aa mature protein predominantly found in neutrophil granules) is the target for protease inhibition by alpha1-antitrypsin, and its unopposed release destroys tissue at sites of inflammation. We hypothesize that a perturbed interaction between neutrophil elastase and serpins or other substrates may regulate mechanisms governing the clock-like timing of haematopoiesis.","date":"1999 Dec;23(4):433-6.","date_created":"2020-02-01T20:51:56.344617+00:00","journal":"Nature genetics","doi":""}}],"sex":"Unknown","diagnosis":[{"submitted_by":"/users/620abd6f-1e33-41be-9698-41c50e0661de/","associatedFamilies":["/families/ccbd1f70-a52b-4e3e-9e2c-5c0956b00801/","/families/27e0f95e-1b0f-4887-9203-231c406a7249/"],"term":"neutropenia","associatedGroups":[],"uuid":"83de1d1f-8708-43d0-9c8c-4679f92360d6","associatedInterpretations":[],"@type":["disease","item"],"associatedIndividuals":["/individuals/81b33546-7bd6-4edf-8361-fcf0cdd4d6da/","/individuals/c16d4d11-9e98-4915-a4e8-436eabbae3a2/","/individuals/cc35d0f8-eb62-4835-bc6d-4835c2d486eb/","/individuals/f35c7f53-e8e0-42e0-ad56-a960a705c285/","/individuals/f4c1a353-6e14-4813-83cd-9185339f0670/","/individuals/487ecdc4-a557-4e56-8665-5d661362f702/","/individuals/fbd29295-2c32-4fbf-ba56-fe92de091fd9/"],"@id":"/diseases/83de1d1f-8708-43d0-9c8c-4679f92360d6/","diseaseId":"MONDO_0001475","synonyms":[],"last_modified":"2020-01-17T20:11:06.557434+00:00","modified_by":"/users/620abd6f-1e33-41be-9698-41c50e0661de/","phenotypes":[],"status":"in progress","date_created":"2020-01-17T20:11:06.557444+00:00","associatedGdm":["/gdm/e8b35a4e-b551-491e-a46b-dd408dad26f5/"],"description":"","schema_version":"2"}],"proband":true,"modified_by":{"uuid":"620abd6f-1e33-41be-9698-41c50e0661de","user_status":"active","@type":["user","item"],"last_name":"Wei","email":"sainan.wei@uky.edu","first_name":"Sainan","date_created":"2018-10-26T07:00:00+00:00","lab":"/labs/curator/","affiliation":["10014","10023"],"title":"Sainan Wei","@id":"/users/620abd6f-1e33-41be-9698-41c50e0661de/"},"hpoIdInDiagnosis":[],"is_proband":"Yes","hpoIdInElimination":[]}],"modified_by":"/users/620abd6f-1e33-41be-9698-41c50e0661de/","groups":[],"status":"in progress","number_group":"","date_created":"2020-02-01T21:11:33.294649+00:00","affiliation":"10023","families":[{"@type":["family","item"],"label":"619","associatedGroups":[],"active":true,"uuid":"27e0f95e-1b0f-4887-9203-231c406a7249","modified_by":{"uuid":"620abd6f-1e33-41be-9698-41c50e0661de","user_status":"active","@type":["user","item"],"last_name":"Wei","email":"sainan.wei@uky.edu","first_name":"Sainan","date_created":"2018-10-26T07:00:00+00:00","lab":"/labs/curator/","affiliation":["10014","10023"],"title":"Sainan Wei","@id":"/users/620abd6f-1e33-41be-9698-41c50e0661de/"},"otherPMIDs":[],"ageRangeType":"","schema_version":"7","@id":"/families/27e0f95e-1b0f-4887-9203-231c406a7249/","last_modified":"2020-02-01T22:00:09.904885+00:00","individualIncluded":[{"ageType":"","@type":["individual","item"],"label":"Family 619-I","associatedGroups":[],"active":true,"uuid":"fbd29295-2c32-4fbf-ba56-fe92de091fd9","scores":[{"submitted_by":{"uuid":"620abd6f-1e33-41be-9698-41c50e0661de","user_status":"active","@type":["user","item"],"last_name":"Wei","email":"sainan.wei@uky.edu","first_name":"Sainan","date_created":"2018-10-26T07:00:00+00:00","lab":"/labs/curator/","affiliation":["10014","10023"],"title":"Sainan Wei","@id":"/users/620abd6f-1e33-41be-9698-41c50e0661de/"},"scoreStatus":"Score","@type":["evidenceScore","item"],"caseControl_scored":[],"evidenceType":"Individual","uuid":"e5fca27c-57ad-42ff-b114-b6ba65e64248","caseInfoType":"OTHER_VARIANT_TYPE_WITH_GENE_IMPACT","affiliation":"10023","score":1.5,"scoreExplanation":"This study assembled 13 pedigrees, two families 619 and 601 were used for linkage studies and found evidence in the ELANE gene on 19p13.3.

disease in which blood-cell production from the bone marrow oscillates with 21-day periodicity. Circulating neutrophils vary between almost normal numbers and zero. During intervals of neutropenia, affected individuals are at risk for opportunistic infection. Monocytes, platelets, lymphocytes and reticulocytes also cycle with the same frequency. Here we use a genome-wide screen and positional cloning to map the locus to chromosome 19p13.3. We identified 7 different single-base substitutions in the gene (ELA2) encoding neutrophil elastase (EC 3. 4.21.37, also known as leukocyte elastase, elastase 2 and medullasin), a serine protease of neutrophil and monocyte granules, on unique haplotypes in 13 of 13 families as well as a new mutation in a sporadic case. Neutrophil elastase (a 240-aa mature protein predominantly found in neutrophil granules) is the target for protease inhibition by alpha1-antitrypsin, and its unopposed release destroys tissue at sites of inflammation. We hypothesize that a perturbed interaction between neutrophil elastase and serpins or other substrates may regulate mechanisms governing the clock-like timing of haematopoiesis.","date":"1999

The patients were mild to severe neutropenic and suffered from various recurrent bacterial infections. Mutations in the genes ELANE, CSF3R and GFI1 have been reported in patients with autosomal dominant congenital neutropenias. Using a small-scale linkage analysis with markers around the ELANE, CSF3R, CSF3 and GFI1 genes, we were able to determine that the disease segregated with markers around the ELANE gene.

We recently determined that the majority of cases result from de novo or autosomal dominantly inherited heterozygous mutations in ELA2, encoding neutrophil elastase. Neutrophil elastase is a chymotryptic serine protease localized in granules of neutrophils and monocytes and is the major target of inhibition of the serpin alpha(1)-antitrypsin. The mutations causing severe congenital neutropenia consist of amino acid missense substitutions, in-frame deletion, splice donor mutation producing a deletion, splice acceptor mutation causing insertion of novel residues, and protein truncating mutations of the carboxyl terminus resulting from nonsense substitutions and deletions leading to frameshifts. We have expressed 14 mutant forms of neutrophil elastase in vitro and have characterized their biochemical properties. The mutations have variable effects on proteolytic activity, eliminating the possibility that the disease results from haploinsufficiency. There is no evidence that the mutant enzymes are cytotoxic. The mutant enzymes retain vulnerability to inhibition by alpha(1)-antitrypsin, but demonstrate variable avidity for interaction with this serpin. Somewhat surprisingly, the mutant enzymes inhibit the wild type enzyme when both are coexpressed within the same cell, suggesting the potential to interfere with normal subcellular trafficking or post-translational processing.","date":"2001 Apr 27;276(17):14230-41.","date_created":"2020-02-01T23:33:37.880100+00:00","journal":"The Journal of biological chemistry","doi":""},{"submitted_by":{"uuid":"620abd6f-1e33-41be-9698-41c50e0661de","user_status":"active","@type":["user","item"],"last_name":"Wei","email":"sainan.wei@uky.edu","first_name":"Sainan","date_created":"2018-10-26T07:00:00+00:00","lab":"/labs/curator/","affiliation":["10014","10023"],"title":"Sainan Wei","@id":"/users/620abd6f-1e33-41be-9698-41c50e0661de/"},"@type":["article","item"],"active":true,"uuid":"184dc364-dcfe-4936-a21b-9f733194e2af","pmcid":"","authors":["van de Vosse E","Verhard EM","Tool AJ","de Visser AW","Kuijpers TW","Hiemstra PS","van Dissel JT"],"pmid":"20803142","@id":"/articles/20803142/","schema_version":"1","last_modified":"2020-02-01T23:12:13.492017+00:00","modified_by":"/users/620abd6f-1e33-41be-9698-41c50e0661de/","title":"Severe congenital neutropenia in a multigenerational family with a novel neutrophil elastase (ELANE) mutation.","abstract":"We have analysed a family with nine congenital neutropenia patients in four generations, several of which we have studied in a long-term follow-up of over 25\u00a0years.

Recently the locus for autosomal dominant cyclic neutropenia was mapped to chromosome 19p13.3, and this disease is now attributable to mutations of the gene encoding neutrophil elastase (the ELA2 gene). The authors hypothesized that congenital neutropenia is also due to mutations of neutrophil elastase. Patients with congenital neutropenia, cyclic neutropenia, or Shwachman-Diamond syndrome were referred to the Severe Chronic Neutropenia International Registry. Referring physicians provided hematologic and clinical data. Mutational analysis was performed by sequencing polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-amplified genomic DNA for each of the 5 exons of the neutrophil ELA2 gene and 20 bases of the flanking regions. RNA from bone marrow mononuclear cells was used to determine if the affected patients expressed both the normal and the abnormal transcript. Twenty-two of 25 patients with congenital neutropenia had 18 different heterozygous mutations. Four of 4 patients with cyclic neutropenia and 0 of 3 patients with Shwachman-Diamond syndrome had mutations. For 5 patients with congenital neutropenia having mutations predicted to alter RNA splicing or transcript structure, reverse transcriptase-PCR showed expression of both normal and abnormal transcripts. In cyclic neutropenia, the mutations appeared to cluster near the active site of the molecule, whereas the opposite face was predominantly affected by the mutations found in congenital neutropenia. This study indicates that mutations of the gene encoding neutrophil elastase are probably the most common cause for severe congenital neutropenia as well as the cause for sporadic and autosomal dominant cyclic neutropenia.","date":"2000 Oct 1;96(7):2317-22.","date_created":"2020-02-01T14:39:12.442887+00:00","journal":"Blood","doi":""}],"status":"in progress","date_created":"2020-02-01T23:22:32.945942+00:00","affiliation":"10023","variants":[{"maneTranscriptTitle":"","@type":["variant","item"],"uuid":"e1038b91-ce27-44b1-94b5-2904503c89da","otherDescription":"","dbSNPIds":[],"@id":"/variants/e1038b91-ce27-44b1-94b5-2904503c89da/","schema_version":"6","last_modified":"2020-02-01T23:22:15.877447+00:00","hgvsNames":{"GRCh38":"NC_000019.10:g.852977G>T","GRCh37":"NC_000019.9:g.852977G>T","NCBI36":"NC_000019.8:g.803977G>T","others":["NG_009627.1:g.5687G>T","LRG_57:g.5687G>T","NM_001972.2:c.169G>T","LRG_57t1:c.169G>T","XM_011527775.1:c.169G>T","XM_011527776.1:c.169G>T","NM_001972.3:c.169G>T","NM_001972.4:c.169G>T","ENST00000263621.1:c.169G>T","ENST00000590230.5:c.169G>T"]},"carId":"CA402914705","status":"in progress","canonicalTranscriptTitle":"XM_011527775.1(ELANE):c.169G>T (p.Ala57Ser)","date_created":"2020-02-01T23:22:15.877457+00:00","clinVarSCVs":[],"clinvarVariantTitle":"","variant_identifier":"CA402914705","submitted_by":{"uuid":"620abd6f-1e33-41be-9698-41c50e0661de","user_status":"active","@type":["user","item"],"last_name":"Wei","email":"sainan.wei@uky.edu","first_name":"Sainan","date_created":"2018-10-26T07:00:00+00:00","lab":"/labs/curator/","affiliation":["10014","10023"],"title":"Sainan Wei","@id":"/users/620abd6f-1e33-41be-9698-41c50e0661de/"},"source":"ClinGen AR","variation_type":"","associatedPathogenicities":[],"molecular_consequence":"","modified_by":"/users/620abd6f-1e33-41be-9698-41c50e0661de/","associatedInterpretations":[],"clinVarRCVs":[],"clinvarVariantId":""}],"method":{"previousTesting":true,"previousTestingDescription":"blood count","dateTime":"2020-02-15T12:25:38-05:00","specificMutationsGenotypedMethod":"A small-scale linkage analysis with markers around the ELANE, CSF3R, CSF3 and GFI1 genes was performed,  the disease is segregated with markers around the ELANE gene.

myelocytic-committed progenitor cells. Severe congenital neutropenia 1 (SCN1) caused by ELANE mutations is a rare disease characterized by very low numbers of circulating neutrophils. Little is known about the functional characteristics of the SCN1 granulocytes, except that eosinophilia has been noticed in both bone marrow and peripheral blood. In this study, we profiled the number and function of granulocytes in patients suffering from SCN1.","date":"2019 Jun 8;19(1):189.","date_created":"2020-02-02T15:35:55.513110+00:00","journal":"BMC pediatrics","doi":""}}],"expression":{"alteredExpression":{},"normalExpression":{},"organOfTissue":[]},"modified_by":{"uuid":"620abd6f-1e33-41be-9698-41c50e0661de","user_status":"active","@type":["user","item"],"last_name":"Wei","email":"sainan.wei@uky.edu","first_name":"Sainan","date_created":"2018-10-26T07:00:00+00:00","lab":"/labs/curator/","affiliation":["10014","10023"],"title":"Sainan Wei","@id":"/users/620abd6f-1e33-41be-9698-41c50e0661de/"},"rescue":{}},{"@type":["experimental","item"],"label":"NADPH oxidase activity","assessments":[],"active":true,"uuid":"6e53841c-0ab2-4d25-84ad-abdcc3cf7256","functionalAlteration":{"functionalAlterationType":"Patient cells","evidenceInPaper":"Fig. 3, Fig. 4 and Fig. 5","patientCells":"CL:0000094","descriptionOfGeneAlteration":"Structural perturbations of elastase protein encoded by ELANE gene with aberrant intracellular processing and trafficking are proposed to be the main cause behind the blockade of neutrophil maturation and induction of cell death in the bone marrow of SCN1 patients","evidenceForNormalFunction":"This study showed all 9 SCN patients with 8 different variants of ELANE gene had eosinophilia and neutrophenia, the ROS profiles of eosinophils from these patients are similar to that from healthy control, but eosniophilia cannot compensate for the neutropenia regarding ROS-mediated function in these patients due to different ROS profiles of eosinophiles and neutropenia.

subcellular targeting of the G185R neutrophil elastase mutant associated with severe congenital neutropenia induces premature apoptosis of differentiating promyelocytes.","abstract":"Mutations in the ELA2 gene encoding neutrophil elastase (NE) are present in most patients with severe congenital neutropenia (SCN). However, the mechanisms by which these mutations cause neutropenia remain unknown. To investigate the effects of mutant NE expression on granulopoiesis, we used the HL-60 promyelocytic cell line retrovirally transduced with the G185R NE mutant that is associated with a severe SCN phenotype. We show that the mutant enzyme accelerates apoptosis of differentiating but not of proliferating cells. Using metabolic labeling, confocal immunofluorescence microscopy, and immunoblot analysis of subcellular fractions, we also demonstrate that the G185R mutant is abnormally processed and localizes predominantly to the nuclear and plasma membranes rather than to the cytoplasmic compartment observed with the wild-type (WT) enzyme. Expression of the G185R mutant appeared to alter the subcellular distribution and expression of adaptor protein 3 (AP3), which traffics proteins from the trans-Golgi apparatus to the endosome. These observations provide further insight into potential mechanisms by which NE mutations cause neutropenia and suggest that abnormal protein trafficking and accelerated apoptosis of differentiating myeloid cells contribute to the severe SCN phenotype resulting from the G185R mutation.","date":"2005 May

ELA2 gene encoding neutrophil elastase (NE) are present in most patients with severe congenital neutropenia (SCN). However, the mechanisms by which these mutations cause neutropenia remain unknown. To investigate the effects of mutant NE expression on granulopoiesis, we used the HL-60 promyelocytic cell line retrovirally transduced with the G185R NE mutant that is associated with a severe SCN phenotype. We show that the mutant enzyme accelerates apoptosis of differentiating but not of proliferating cells. Using metabolic labeling, confocal immunofluorescence microscopy, and immunoblot analysis of subcellular fractions, we also demonstrate that the G185R mutant is abnormally processed and localizes predominantly to the nuclear and plasma membranes rather than to the cytoplasmic compartment observed with the wild-type (WT) enzyme. Expression of the G185R mutant appeared to alter the subcellular distribution and expression of adaptor protein 3 (AP3), which traffics proteins from the trans-Golgi apparatus to the endosome. These observations provide further insight into potential mechanisms by which NE mutations cause neutropenia and suggest that abnormal protein trafficking and accelerated apoptosis of differentiating myeloid cells contribute to the severe SCN phenotype resulting from the G185R mutation.","date":"2005 May 1;105(9):3397-404.","date_created":"2020-02-09T17:45:45.687577+00:00","journal":"Blood","doi":""}}],"expression":{"alteredExpression":{},"normalExpression":{},"organOfTissue":[]},"modified_by":{"uuid":"620abd6f-1e33-41be-9698-41c50e0661de","user_status":"active","@type":["user","item"],"last_name":"Wei","email":"sainan.wei@uky.edu","first_name":"Sainan","date_created":"2018-10-26T07:00:00+00:00","lab":"/labs/curator/","affiliation":["10014","10023"],"title":"Sainan Wei","@id":"/users/620abd6f-1e33-41be-9698-41c50e0661de/"},"rescue":{}},{"@type":["experimental","item"],"label":"Immunoblot assay","assessments":[],"active":true,"uuid":"cc91c065-3566-44cf-89d1-1f1ba64e2fcc","functionalAlteration":{},"biochemicalFunction":{"geneFunctionConsistentWithPhenotype":{"phenotypeHPO":[]},"geneWithSameFunctionSameDisease":{}},"scores":[{"submitted_by":{"uuid":"620abd6f-1e33-41be-9698-41c50e0661de","user_status":"active","@type":["user","item"],"last_name":"Wei","email":"sainan.wei@uky.edu","first_name":"Sainan","date_created":"2018-10-26T07:00:00+00:00","lab":"/labs/curator/","affiliation":["10014","10023"],"title":"Sainan Wei","@id":"/users/620abd6f-1e33-41be-9698-41c50e0661de/"},"scoreStatus":"Score","@type":["evidenceScore","item"],"caseControl_scored":[],"evidenceType":"Experimental","uuid":"1767ab86-0e9d-4b0e-ad45-6c0a7fc86d92","affiliation":"10023","@id":"/evidencescore/1767ab86-0e9d-4b0e-ad45-6c0a7fc86d92/","schema_version":"2","individual_scored":[],"last_modified":"2020-04-23T23:05:52.555786+00:00","evidenceScored":"cc91c065-3566-44cf-89d1-1f1ba64e2fcc","modified_by":{"uuid":"620abd6f-1e33-41be-9698-41c50e0661de","user_status":"active","@type":["user","item"],"last_name":"Wei","email":"sainan.wei@uky.edu","first_name":"Sainan","date_created":"2018-10-26T07:00:00+00:00","lab":"/labs/curator/","affiliation":["10014","10023"],"title":"Sainan Wei","@id":"/users/620abd6f-1e33-41be-9698-41c50e0661de/"},"status":"in progress","date_created":"2020-04-23T23:05:52.555609+00:00","experimental_scored":["/experimental/cc91c065-3566-44cf-89d1-1f1ba64e2fcc/"],"calculatedScore":0.5}],"@id":"/experimental/cc91c065-3566-44cf-89d1-1f1ba64e2fcc/","schema_version":"8","last_modified":"2020-04-23T23:05:52.663844+00:00","status":"in progress","date_created":"2020-02-09T20:17:26.095762+00:00","affiliation":"10023","submitted_by":{"uuid":"620abd6f-1e33-41be-9698-41c50e0661de","user_status":"active","@type":["user","item"],"last_name":"Wei","email":"sainan.wei@uky.edu","first_name":"Sainan","date_created":"2018-10-26T07:00:00+00:00","lab":"/labs/curator/","affiliation":["10014","10023"],"title":"Sainan Wei","@id":"/users/620abd6f-1e33-41be-9698-41c50e0661de/"},"evidenceType":"Protein Interactions","proteinInteractions":{"evidenceInPaper":"Fig. 6","experimentalInteractionDetection":"coimmunoprecipitation (MI:0019)","relationshipOfOtherGenesToDisese":"Normally AP3 (adaptor protein 3) directs intracellular targetting of NE.

We hypothesized that inhibitors of NE, acting either by directly inhibiting enzymatic activity or as chaperones for the mutant protein, might be effective as therapy for CyN and SCN. We investigated \u03b2-lactam-based inhibitors of human NE (Merck Research Laboratories, Kenilworth, NJ, USA), focusing on 1 inhibitor called MK0339, a potent, orally absorbed agent that had been tested in clinical trials and shown to have a favorable safety profile. Because fresh, primary bone marrow cells are rarely available in sufficient quantities for research studies, we used 3 cellular models: patient-derived, induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs); HL60 cells transiently expressing mutant NE; and HL60 cells with regulated expression of the mutant enzyme.

Cyclic neutropenia is usually diagnosed within the first year of life based on oscillation of neutrophils and fever with approximately 21 day periodicity while congenital neutropenia is diagnosed right after birth with first sign of omphalitis.  Individuals with ELANE-related neutropenia are at risk of developing myelodysplasia syndrome (MDS) or acute myelogenous leukemia (AML).\nIt is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Most of pathogenic variants reported are missense, splicing defects, small in frame, frame shift deletion or premature stop codons with dominant negative effect. Full gene deletions leading to haploinsufficiency do not cause neutropenia (PMID: 31427279). At least 100 pathogenic variants have been reported in over 100 individuals from more than 40 families.  In this Curation familial and do novo missense, small deletion and splicing variants in individuals with CyN or SCN are used from 4 studies (PMID: 11001877, 10581030, 10581030 and 20803142).

Cyclic neutropenia is usually diagnosed within the first year of life based on oscillation of neutrophils and fever with approximately 21 day periodicity. Congenital neutropenia is generally diagnosed right after birth and my present with omphalitis. Individuals with ELANE-related neutropenia are at risk of developing myelodysplasia syndrome (MDS) or acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). It is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Most reported pathogenic variants are missense, splicing defects, small in-frame deletions, frameshift deletions or premature stop codons with dominant negative effect. Full gene deletions leading to haploinsufficiency do not cause neutropenia (PMID: 31427279). At least 100 pathogenic variants have been reported in over 100 individuals from more than 40 families. This curation includes both familial and de novo missense, small deletion and splicing variants in individuals with CyN or SCN from 4 studies (PMID: 11001877, 10581030, 10581030 and 20803142). Three studies (PMID: 15657182, 31176364 and 28754797) were evaluated encompassing biochemical function, protein interaction, functional alteration from patients cells with different variants, and cell models expressing different variants further confirm the gene and disease validity.
