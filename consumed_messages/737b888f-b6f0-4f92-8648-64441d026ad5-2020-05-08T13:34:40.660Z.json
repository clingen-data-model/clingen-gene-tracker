Variants in DSC2 were first reported in humans with this disease as early as 2006 (Syrris et al., PMID: 17033975). At least 13 variants (e.g. missense, nonsense, frameshift) have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level\ndata and experimental data.

To date, mutations in four genes encoding major desmosomal proteins (plakoglobin, desmoplakin, plakophilin-2, and desmoglein-2) have been implicated in the pathogenesis of ARVD/C. We screened 77 probands with ARVD/C for mutations in desmocollin-2 (DSC2), a gene coding for a desmosomal cadherin. Two heterozygous mutations--a deletion and an insertion--were identified in four probands. Both mutations result in frameshifts and premature truncation of the desmocollin-2 protein. For the first time, we have identified mutations in desmocollin-2 in patients with ARVD/C, a finding that is consistent with the hypothesis that ARVD/C is a disease of the desmosome.","doi":"","schema_version":"1","date":"2006

To date, mutations in four genes encoding major desmosomal proteins (plakoglobin, desmoplakin, plakophilin-2, and desmoglein-2) have been implicated in the pathogenesis of ARVD/C. We screened 77 probands with ARVD/C for mutations in desmocollin-2 (DSC2), a gene coding for a desmosomal cadherin. Two heterozygous mutations--a deletion and an insertion--were identified in four probands. Both mutations result in frameshifts and premature truncation of the desmocollin-2 protein. For the first time, we have identified mutations in desmocollin-2 in patients with ARVD/C, a finding that is consistent with the hypothesis that ARVD/C is a disease of the desmosome.","doi":"","schema_version":"1","date":"2006

To date, mutations in four genes encoding major desmosomal proteins (plakoglobin, desmoplakin, plakophilin-2, and desmoglein-2) have been implicated in the pathogenesis of ARVD/C. We screened 77 probands with ARVD/C for mutations in desmocollin-2 (DSC2), a gene coding for a desmosomal cadherin. Two heterozygous mutations--a deletion and an insertion--were identified in four probands. Both mutations result in frameshifts and premature truncation of the desmocollin-2 protein. For the first time, we have identified mutations in desmocollin-2 in patients with ARVD/C, a finding that is consistent with the hypothesis that ARVD/C is a disease of the desmosome.","doi":"","schema_version":"1","date":"2006

To date, mutations in four genes encoding major desmosomal proteins (plakoglobin, desmoplakin, plakophilin-2, and desmoglein-2) have been implicated in the pathogenesis of ARVD/C. We screened 77 probands with ARVD/C for mutations in desmocollin-2 (DSC2), a gene coding for a desmosomal cadherin. Two heterozygous mutations--a deletion and an insertion--were identified in four probands. Both mutations result in frameshifts and premature truncation of the desmocollin-2 protein. For the first time, we have identified mutations in desmocollin-2 in patients with ARVD/C, a finding that is consistent with the hypothesis that ARVD/C is a disease of the desmosome.","doi":"","schema_version":"1","date":"2006

To date, mutations in four genes encoding major desmosomal proteins (plakoglobin, desmoplakin, plakophilin-2, and desmoglein-2) have been implicated in the pathogenesis of ARVD/C. We screened 77 probands with ARVD/C for mutations in desmocollin-2 (DSC2), a gene coding for a desmosomal cadherin. Two heterozygous mutations--a deletion and an insertion--were identified in four probands. Both mutations result in frameshifts and premature truncation of the desmocollin-2 protein. For the first time, we have identified mutations in desmocollin-2 in patients with ARVD/C, a finding that is consistent with the hypothesis that ARVD/C is a disease of the desmosome.","doi":"","schema_version":"1","date":"2006

To date, mutations in four genes encoding major desmosomal proteins (plakoglobin, desmoplakin, plakophilin-2, and desmoglein-2) have been implicated in the pathogenesis of ARVD/C. We screened 77 probands with ARVD/C for mutations in desmocollin-2 (DSC2), a gene coding for a desmosomal cadherin. Two heterozygous mutations--a deletion and an insertion--were identified in four probands. Both mutations result in frameshifts and premature truncation of the desmocollin-2 protein. For the first time, we have identified mutations in desmocollin-2 in patients with ARVD/C, a finding that is consistent with the hypothesis that ARVD/C is a disease of the desmosome.","doi":"","schema_version":"1","date":"2006

cardiomyopathy (ARVC) is a genetically heterogeneous heart-muscle disorder characterized by progressive fibrofatty replacement of right ventricular myocardium and an increased risk of sudden cardiac death. Mutations in desmosomal proteins that cause ARVC have been previously described; therefore, we investigated 88 unrelated patients with the disorder for mutations in human desmosomal cadherin desmocollin-2 (DSC2). We identified a heterozygous splice-acceptor-site mutation in intron 5 (c.631-2A-->G) of the DSC2 gene, which led to the use of a cryptic splice-acceptor site and the creation of a downstream premature termination codon. Quantitative analysis of cardiac DSC2 expression in patient specimens revealed a marked reduction in the abundance of the mutant transcript. Morpholino knockdown in zebrafish embryos revealed a requirement for dsc2 in the establishment of the normal myocardial structure and function, with reduced desmosomal plaque area, loss of the desmosome extracellular electron-dense midlines, and associated myocardial contractility defects. These data identify DSC2 mutations as a cause of ARVC in humans and demonstrate that physiologic levels of DSC2 are crucial for normal cardiac desmosome formation, early cardiac morphogenesis, and cardiac function.","doi":"","schema_version":"1","date":"2006

cardiomyopathy (ARVC) is a genetically heterogeneous heart-muscle disorder characterized by progressive fibrofatty replacement of right ventricular myocardium and an increased risk of sudden cardiac death. Mutations in desmosomal proteins that cause ARVC have been previously described; therefore, we investigated 88 unrelated patients with the disorder for mutations in human desmosomal cadherin desmocollin-2 (DSC2). We identified a heterozygous splice-acceptor-site mutation in intron 5 (c.631-2A-->G) of the DSC2 gene, which led to the use of a cryptic splice-acceptor site and the creation of a downstream premature termination codon. Quantitative analysis of cardiac DSC2 expression in patient specimens revealed a marked reduction in the abundance of the mutant transcript. Morpholino knockdown in zebrafish embryos revealed a requirement for dsc2 in the establishment of the normal myocardial structure and function, with reduced desmosomal plaque area, loss of the desmosome extracellular electron-dense midlines, and associated myocardial contractility defects. These data identify DSC2 mutations as a cause of ARVC in humans and demonstrate that physiologic levels of DSC2 are crucial for normal cardiac desmosome formation, early cardiac morphogenesis, and cardiac function.","doi":"","schema_version":"1","date":"2006

in cardiac desmosomal genes. Desmosomes are cell-cell junctions mediating adhesion of cardiomyocytes; however, the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying the disease remain widely unknown. Desmocollin-2 is a desmosomal cadherin serving as an anchor molecule required to reconstitute homeostatic intercellular adhesion with desmoglein-2. Cardiac specific lack of desmoglein-2 leads to severe cardiomyopathy, whereas overexpression does not. In contrast, the corresponding data for desmocollin-2 are incomplete, in particular from the view of protein overexpression. Therefore, we developed a mouse model overexpressing desmocollin-2 to determine its potential contribution to cardiomyopathy and intercellular adhesion pathology.","doi":"","schema_version":"1","date":"2017 Mar 24;12(3):e0174019.","active":true,"pmcid":"","last_modified":"2017-12-15T20:53:15.861710+00:00"},"experimentalData":[{"submitted_by":{"uuid":"84a6e93b-5075-4dfb-9de5-a9fcde89abc9","email":"jennifer.mcglaughon@gmail.com","lab":"/labs/curator/","date_created":"2017-01-05T08:00:00+00:00","user_status":"active","affiliation":["10003","10008","10009","10010","10011","10023","10026","10049"],"title":"Jen McGlaughon","last_name":"McGlaughon","@id":"/users/84a6e93b-5075-4dfb-9de5-a9fcde89abc9/","@type":["user","item"],"first_name":"Jen"},"uuid":"3c2ac3a6-a2b0-4dfc-bc33-b2875bc49e5d","proteinInteractions":{},"label":"Brodehl 2017 OE mouse model","affiliation":"10003","functionalAlteration":{},"expression":{"normalExpression":{},"alteredExpression":{},"organOfTissue":[]},"assessments":[],"scores":[{"submitted_by":{"uuid":"84a6e93b-5075-4dfb-9de5-a9fcde89abc9","email":"jennifer.mcglaughon@gmail.com","lab":"/labs/curator/","date_created":"2017-01-05T08:00:00+00:00","user_status":"active","affiliation":["10003","10008","10009","10010","10011","10023","10026","10049"],"title":"Jen McGlaughon","last_name":"McGlaughon","@id":"/users/84a6e93b-5075-4dfb-9de5-a9fcde89abc9/","@type":["user","item"],"first_name":"Jen"},"uuid":"5139cb4a-9cb0-4118-a7c4-9b2ed9ffc720","schema_version":"2","date_created":"2017-12-15T21:00:26.994663+00:00","affiliation":"10003","caseControl_scored":[],"@id":"/evidencescore/5139cb4a-9cb0-4118-a7c4-9b2ed9ffc720/","scoreStatus":"Score","calculatedScore":2,"status":"in progress","@type":["evidenceScore","item"],"scoreExplanation":"Mouse model did not fully recapitulate the disease.","last_modified":"2019-06-28T15:35:06.370591+00:00","individual_scored":[],"score":1.5,"experimental_scored":["/experimental/3c2ac3a6-a2b0-4dfc-bc33-b2875bc49e5d/"],"evidenceType":"Experimental","modified_by":{"uuid":"c0a70214-08a8-48a0-ba8d-521bed321d4a","email":"wrightmw@stanford.edu","lab":"/labs/curator/","date_created":"2016-11-04T07:00:00+00:00","user_status":"active","affiliation":["10006","10005","10009","10011","10018","10019","10007","10034","10048","10049","10003","10042","10021","10012","10013","10014","10057","10058","10059","10060","10061","10062","10015","10023","10016","10008","10026"],"title":"Matt Wright","last_name":"Wright","@id":"/users/c0a70214-08a8-48a0-ba8d-521bed321d4a/","@type":["user","item"],"first_name":"Matt"}}],"evidenceType":"Model Systems","last_modified":"2019-06-28T15:35:06.365113+00:00","biochemicalFunction":{"geneWithSameFunctionSameDisease":{},"geneFunctionConsistentWithPhenotype":{"phenotypeHPO":[]}},"date_created":"2017-12-15T21:00:27.123588+00:00","@id":"/experimental/3c2ac3a6-a2b0-4dfc-bc33-b2875bc49e5d/","status":"in progress","modelSystems":{"phenotypeFreetextObserved":"Epicardial fibrosis, enlarged heart, upregulation of heart failure markers, LV-FS and LV-EF were decreased, increased LVIDd (left ventricular dilation).","explanation":"Mice developed severe mycocardial necrosis and fibrosis.

cadherin-like adhesion molecules of desmosomes. We have determined the full cDNA sequence of a murine desmocollin, the homologue of human and bovine type 2 desmocollins (DSC2), and studied its tissue distribution and expression in stratified epithelia. An 8.5 day mouse embryo cDNA library was screened yielding overlapping clones which encoded the mouse DSC2. This gene has an open reading frame of 2710 base pairs (bp) encoding a polypeptide of 902 amino acids (aa). The polypeptide comprises a signal peptide, a precursor peptide, and a mature protein of 766 aa having an extracellular domain of 549 aa, a single transmembrane domain and a cytoplasmic domain of 184 aa. Like other desmocollins, murine DSC2 has two products, Dsc2a and Dsc2b, produced by alternative splicing of a 46 bp exon which encodes 11 COOH-terminal aa followed by an in-frame stop codon. Inclusion of this exon forms Dsc2b which is 54 aa shorter than Dsc2a. Mouse Dsc2a shows 75.7% amino acid identity to human and 63.3% identity to bovine Dsc2a. The mouse desmocollin is also homologous to the cadherins; 32.2% to the most closely related typical cadherin, human N-cadherin.

We have determined the full cDNA sequence of a murine desmocollin, the homologue of human and bovine type 2 desmocollins (DSC2), and studied its tissue distribution and expression in stratified epithelia. An 8.5 day mouse embryo cDNA library was screened yielding overlapping clones which encoded the mouse DSC2. This gene has an open reading frame of 2710 base pairs (bp) encoding a polypeptide of 902 amino acids (aa). The polypeptide comprises a signal peptide, a precursor peptide, and a mature protein of 766 aa having an extracellular domain of 549 aa, a single transmembrane domain and a cytoplasmic domain of 184 aa. Like other desmocollins, murine DSC2 has two products, Dsc2a and Dsc2b, produced by alternative splicing of a 46 bp exon which encodes 11 COOH-terminal aa followed by an in-frame stop codon. Inclusion of this exon forms Dsc2b which is 54 aa shorter than Dsc2a. Mouse Dsc2a shows 75.7% amino acid identity to human and 63.3% identity to bovine Dsc2a. The mouse desmocollin is also homologous to the cadherins; 32.2% to the most closely related typical cadherin, human N-cadherin. DSC2 is ubiquitously expressed in epithelial tissues and the heart of adult mice and from the blastocyst stage of development. In situ hybridization shows that the gene is most strongly expressed suprabasally in stratified epithelia, similar to the expression of bovine DSC2.","doi":"","schema_version":"1","date":"1994

Variants in DSC2 were first reported in humans with this disease as early as 2006 (Syrris et al., PMID: 17033975). At least 13 variants (e.g. missense, nonsense, frameshift) have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level\ndata and experimental data. Summary of Case Level Data: 8.5 points. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 13 probands in 6 publications (PMIDs: 17963498,  21062920, 23863954, 17186466, 18957847, 17033975). This gene-disease relationship is supported by animal models, expression studies, and protein interactions. In summary, DSC2 is definitively associated with ARVD (AD) and ARVD with mild palmoplantar keratoderma with or without woolly hair (AR). This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.  This classification was approved by the ClinGen Arrythmogenic Right Ventricular Cardiomyopathy Gene Curation Expert Panel on September 14, 2018 (SOP Version 6).","classificationStatus":"Approved","reasons":"","classificationPoints":{"segregation":{"totalPointsGiven":0,"evidenceCountExome":0,"evidenceCountTotal":0,"evidencePointsExome":0,"evidencePointsCandidate":0,"pointsCounted":0,"evidenceCountCandidate":0},"geneticEvidenceTotal":8.5,"autosomalDominantOrXlinkedDisorder":{"probandWithPredictedOrProvenNullVariant":{"evidenceCount":9,"pointsCounted":7,"totalPointsGiven":7},"variantIsDeNovo":{"evidenceCount":0,"pointsCounted":0,"totalPointsGiven":0},"probandWithOtherVariantTypeWithGeneImpact":{"evidenceCount":4,"pointsCounted":1.5,"totalPointsGiven":1.5}},"function":{"proteinInteractions":{"evidenceCount":1,"totalPointsGiven":1},"expression":{"evidenceCount":2,"totalPointsGiven":1},"pointsCounted":2,"totalPointsGiven":2,"biochemicalFunctions":{"evidenceCount":0,"totalPointsGiven":0}},"modelsRescue":{"modelsNonHuman":{"evidenceCount":1,"totalPointsGiven":1.5},"pointsCounted":3.5,"rescuePatientCells":{"evidenceCount":0,"totalPointsGiven":0},"modelsCellCulture":{"evidenceCount":0,"totalPointsGiven":0},"rescueHuman":{"evidenceCount":0,"totalPointsGiven":0},"rescueCellCulture":{"evidenceCount":0,"totalPointsGiven":0},"totalPointsGiven":3.5,"rescueNonHuman":{"evidenceCount":1,"totalPointsGiven":2}},"experimentalEvidenceTotal":5.5,"evidencePointsTotal":14,"autosomalRecessiveDisorder":{"twoVariantsInTransWithOneDeNovo":{"evidenceCount":0,"totalPointsGiven":0},"pointsCounted":0,"twoVariantsWithGeneImpactInTrans":{"evidenceCount":0,"totalPointsGiven":0}},"functionalAlteration":{"pointsCounted":0,"patientCells":{"evidenceCount":0,"totalPointsGiven":0},"totalPointsGiven":0,"nonPatientCells":{"evidenceCount":0,"totalPointsGiven":0}},"caseControl":{"evidenceCount":0,"pointsCounted":0,"totalPointsGiven":0}},"schema_version":"11","approvalReviewDate":"2018-09-14T16:00:00.000Z","approvalSubmitter":"Courtney Thaxton","provisionedClassification":false,"publishAffiliation":"40003","publishSubmitter":"Courtney Thaxton","last_modified":"2020-05-08T13:34:40.660+00:00","additionalApprover":"","publishDate":"2020-05-08T13:34:40.660Z","sopVersion":"7","gdm_associated":["/gdm/499b3d31-14aa-4ff2-bfb6-6e806986255b/"],"alteredClassification":"No Modification","date_created":"2018-01-09T17:06:05.295814+00:00","classificationContributors":["10018"],"classificationDate":"2019-08-06T13:14:27.757Z","@id":"/provisional/74238dee-a847-4f27-9d30-3050c7bf9bf2/","approvalDate":"2020-05-08T13:31:59.280Z","autoClassification":"Definitive","approvedClassification":true,"@type":["provisionalClassification","item"],"publishClassification":true,"classificationApprover":"Cindy James","contradictingEvidence":{"experimental":false,"proband":false,"caseControl":false},"active":true,"contributorComment":"The UNC Biocuration Core previously curated this gene-disesase relationship as part of an initiative to curate the ACMG59 genes.","modified_by":"/users/de63cd49-ce44-4514-8222-91145761f157/"},"resourceId":"74238dee-a847-4f27-9d30-3050c7bf9bf2","approvalStatus":"Approved"}
