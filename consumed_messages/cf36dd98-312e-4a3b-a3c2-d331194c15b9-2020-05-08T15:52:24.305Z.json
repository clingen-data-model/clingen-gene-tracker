In the present study we report on linkage analysis of one additional and unrelated family, which enabled to confirm previous locus assignment. Another family is reported, in which genetic and clinical data suggest linkage to the same locus. Direct sequencing of DNA from individuals belonging to established ARVD1 families failed to detect causative mutations in exonic sequences of four genes (POMT2, TGFbeta3, KIAAA1036 and KIAA0759) expressed in the heart and which defects could possibly induce plasma membrane instability or apoptosis, key features of ARVD
