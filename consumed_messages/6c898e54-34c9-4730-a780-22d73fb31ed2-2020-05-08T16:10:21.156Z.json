However, the significance of these variants in the context of ARVC is unclear as they were either VUS (e.g. p.Arg238Cys) or MYBPC3 variant carriers were also double heterozygotes for variants in other genes associated with cardiomyopathies (29709087, 27194543).

She had a history of Right Ventricular Outflow Tract - Ventricular Tachycardia (RVOT-VT) with an episode of cardiac arrest in the past, and had been treated with ablation 4 years earlier. Her current visit was uneventful, her pregnancy progressing normally. Following the visit she went to a local restaurant where she suffered a cardiac arrest that was unresponsive to therapy. Chest compressions were continued from the time of her collapse until an emergency caesarian section was performed, delivering a healthy female infant. At autopsy a focal area of subtle pallor and myocardial thinning was present at the apex of the right ventricle. Histology showed myocyte degeneration and loss with focal full thickness replacement of myocardium by adipose tissue, consistent with the fatty form of arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC). Molecular studies revealed a variant of unknown significance in the MYBPC3 gene, but no variant known to be associated with ARVC. In view of the subtlety of the lesion on gross examination this diagnosis could have been easily missed, emphasizing the importance of performing histologic examination of subtle gross cardiac lesions.","date_created":"2019-02-13T14:40:32.902390+00:00","pmid":"28843747","modified_by":"/users/1cc648c0-3371-46c7-b00c-613483606da3/"},"active":true,"experimentalData":[],"number_family":"","associatedGdm":[{"modeInheritance":"Autosomal

obstetric clinic for a routine visit at 36 weeks gestation. She had a history of Right Ventricular Outflow Tract - Ventricular Tachycardia (RVOT-VT) with an episode of cardiac arrest in the past, and had been treated with ablation 4 years earlier. Her current visit was uneventful, her pregnancy progressing normally. Following the visit she went to a local restaurant where she suffered a cardiac arrest that was unresponsive to therapy. Chest compressions were continued from the time of her collapse until an emergency caesarian section was performed, delivering a healthy female infant. At autopsy a focal area of subtle pallor and myocardial thinning was present at the apex of the right ventricle. Histology showed myocyte degeneration and loss with focal full thickness replacement of myocardium by adipose tissue, consistent with the fatty form of arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC). Molecular studies revealed a variant of unknown significance in the MYBPC3 gene, but no variant known to be associated with ARVC. In view of the subtlety of the lesion on gross examination this diagnosis could have been easily missed, emphasizing the importance of performing histologic examination of subtle gross cardiac lesions.","date_created":"2019-02-13T14:40:32.902390+00:00","pmid":"28843747","modified_by":"/users/1cc648c0-3371-46c7-b00c-613483606da3/"},"active":true,"experimentalData":[],"number_family":"","associatedGdm":["/gdm/6af5ca55-a7f0-4637-9dab-35e16fc2eac7/"],"number_group":""},{"schema_version":"4","date_created":"2019-02-13T14:46:43.006130+00:00","submitted_by":{"title":"Petros Syrris","lab":"/labs/curator/","@type":["user","item"],"email":"p.syrris@ucl.ac.uk","affiliation":["10003","10035"],"last_name":"Syrris","@id":"/users/1cc648c0-3371-46c7-b00c-613483606da3/","first_name":"Petros","uuid":"1cc648c0-3371-46c7-b00c-613483606da3","user_status":"active","date_created":"2018-03-20T07:00:00+00:00"},"@type":["annotation","item"],"affiliation":"10003","families":[{"hpoIdInDiagnosis":[],"submitted_by":{"title":"Petros Syrris","lab":"/labs/curator/","@type":["user","item"],"email":"p.syrris@ucl.ac.uk","affiliation":["10003","10035"],"last_name":"Syrris","@id":"/users/1cc648c0-3371-46c7-b00c-613483606da3/","first_name":"Petros","uuid":"1cc648c0-3371-46c7-b00c-613483606da3","user_status":"active","date_created":"2018-03-20T07:00:00+00:00"},"race":"","associatedGroups":[],"affiliation":"10003","associatedAnnotations":[{"schema_version":"4","date_created":"2019-02-13T14:46:43.006130+00:00","submitted_by":"/users/1cc648c0-3371-46c7-b00c-613483606da3/","@type":["annotation","item"],"affiliation":"10003","families":["/families/10c4a954-aa2c-40d3-93a5-26cf5e99138b/"],"status":"in progress","@id":"/evidence/c87188f9-735d-4b8c-869a-389361001a5b/","groups":[],"uuid":"c87188f9-735d-4b8c-869a-389361001a5b","individuals":[],"modified_by":"/users/1cc648c0-3371-46c7-b00c-613483606da3/","last_modified":"2019-02-13T15:04:38.856229+00:00","number_experimental":"","number_individual":"","article":{"journal":"European journal of human genetics : EJHG","schema_version":"1","date":"2017 Oct;25(10):1165-1169.","submitted_by":"/users/1cc648c0-3371-46c7-b00c-613483606da3/","@type":["article","item"],"title":"Co-inheritance of mutations associated with arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.","pmcid":"","@id":"/articles/28699631/","authors":["De Bortoli M","Calore C","Lorenzon A","Calore M","Poloni G","Mazzotti E","Rigato I","Marra MP","Melacini P","Iliceto S","Thiene G","Basso C","Daliento L","Corrado D","Rampazzo A","Bauce B"],"uuid":"fdb38a42-4ba6-4918-a004-18698e29ee0e","doi":"","last_modified":"2019-02-13T14:46:42.798583+00:00","active":true,"abstract":"Arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy (ACM) and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) are genetically and phenotypically distinct disorders of the myocardium.

Here we describe for the first time co-inheritance of mutations in genes associated with ACM or HCM in two families with recurrence of both cardiomyopathies. Among the double heterozygotes for mutations in desmoplakin (DSP) and myosin binding protein C (MYBPC3) genes identified in Family A, two were diagnosed with ACM and two with HCM. In Family B, one patient was identified to carry mutations in \u03b1-T-catenin (CTTNA3) and \u03b2-myosin (MYH7) genes, but he does not fulfill the current diagnostic criteria neither for ACM nor for HCM. Interestingly, the double heterozygotes showed a variable clinical expression of both cardiomyopathies and they do not exhibit a more severe phenotype than family members carrying only one of the two mutations.","date_created":"2019-02-13T14:46:42.798560+00:00","pmid":"28699631","modified_by":"/users/1cc648c0-3371-46c7-b00c-613483606da3/"},"active":true,"experimentalData":[],"number_family":1,"associatedGdm":[{"modeInheritance":"Autosomal

cardiomyopathy (HCM) are genetically and phenotypically distinct disorders of the myocardium. Here we describe for the first time co-inheritance of mutations in genes associated with ACM or HCM in two families with recurrence of both cardiomyopathies. Among the double heterozygotes for mutations in desmoplakin (DSP) and myosin binding protein C (MYBPC3) genes identified in Family A, two were diagnosed with ACM and two with HCM. In Family B, one patient was identified to carry mutations in \u03b1-T-catenin (CTTNA3) and \u03b2-myosin (MYH7) genes, but he does not fulfill the current diagnostic criteria neither for ACM nor for HCM. Interestingly, the double heterozygotes showed a variable clinical expression of both cardiomyopathies and they do not exhibit a more severe phenotype than family members carrying only one of the two mutations.","date_created":"2019-02-13T14:46:42.798560+00:00","pmid":"28699631","modified_by":"/users/1cc648c0-3371-46c7-b00c-613483606da3/"},"active":true,"experimentalData":[],"number_family":1,"associatedGdm":[{"modeInheritance":"Autosomal

Here we describe for the first time co-inheritance of mutations in genes associated with ACM or HCM in two families with recurrence of both cardiomyopathies. Among the double heterozygotes for mutations in desmoplakin (DSP) and myosin binding protein C (MYBPC3) genes identified in Family A, two were diagnosed with ACM and two with HCM. In Family B, one patient was identified to carry mutations in \u03b1-T-catenin (CTTNA3) and \u03b2-myosin (MYH7) genes, but he does not fulfill the current diagnostic criteria neither for ACM nor for HCM. Interestingly, the double heterozygotes showed a variable clinical expression of both cardiomyopathies and they do not exhibit a more severe phenotype than family members carrying only one of the two mutations.","date_created":"2019-02-13T14:46:42.798560+00:00","pmid":"28699631","modified_by":"/users/1cc648c0-3371-46c7-b00c-613483606da3/"},"active":true,"experimentalData":[],"number_family":1,"associatedGdm":[{"modeInheritance":"Autosomal

cardiomyopathy (HCM) are genetically and phenotypically distinct disorders of the myocardium. Here we describe for the first time co-inheritance of mutations in genes associated with ACM or HCM in two families with recurrence of both cardiomyopathies. Among the double heterozygotes for mutations in desmoplakin (DSP) and myosin binding protein C (MYBPC3) genes identified in Family A, two were diagnosed with ACM and two with HCM. In Family B, one patient was identified to carry mutations in \u03b1-T-catenin (CTTNA3) and \u03b2-myosin (MYH7) genes, but he does not fulfill the current diagnostic criteria neither for ACM nor for HCM. Interestingly, the double heterozygotes showed a variable clinical expression of both cardiomyopathies and they do not exhibit a more severe phenotype than family members carrying only one of the two mutations.","date_created":"2019-02-13T14:46:42.798560+00:00","pmid":"28699631","modified_by":"/users/1cc648c0-3371-46c7-b00c-613483606da3/"},"active":true,"experimentalData":[],"number_family":1,"associatedGdm":[{"modeInheritance":"Autosomal

cardiomyopathy (HCM) are genetically and phenotypically distinct disorders of the myocardium. Here we describe for the first time co-inheritance of mutations in genes associated with ACM or HCM in two families with recurrence of both cardiomyopathies. Among the double heterozygotes for mutations in desmoplakin (DSP) and myosin binding protein C (MYBPC3) genes identified in Family A, two were diagnosed with ACM and two with HCM. In Family B, one patient was identified to carry mutations in \u03b1-T-catenin (CTTNA3) and \u03b2-myosin (MYH7) genes, but he does not fulfill the current diagnostic criteria neither for ACM nor for HCM. Interestingly, the double heterozygotes showed a variable clinical expression of both cardiomyopathies and they do not exhibit a more severe phenotype than family members carrying only one of the two mutations.","date_created":"2019-02-13T14:46:42.798560+00:00","pmid":"28699631","modified_by":"/users/1cc648c0-3371-46c7-b00c-613483606da3/"},"active":true,"experimentalData":[],"number_family":1,"associatedGdm":["/gdm/6af5ca55-a7f0-4637-9dab-35e16fc2eac7/"],"number_group":""}],"gene":{"schema_version":"1","nameSynonyms":[],"previousNames":["myosin-binding protein C, cardiac"],"@type":["gene","item"],"name":"myosin binding protein C, cardiac","@id":"/genes/MYBPC3/","uuid":"c50553a2-5e46-4a80-9c3a-dedee40a60d0","chromosome":"11p11.2","previousSymbols":["CMH4"],"status":"current","synonyms":["MYBP-C","FHC"],"hgncId":"HGNC:7551","omimIds":["600958"],"entrezId":"4607","pmids":["7744002","8358441"],"symbol":"MYBPC3","locusType":"gene with protein product","hgncStatus":"Approved"},"omimId":"","variantPathogenicity":[],"disease":{"schema_version":"2","date_created":"2017-06-16T01:03:16.788266+00:00","submitted_by":"/users/2a1dcf80-beb1-4b1e-9478-cf7f4904911b/","@type":["disease","item"],"associatedGroups":["/groups/a2de4577-fc8d-4185-b335-8bf5eda0782f/","/groups/a1b2121b-8c0c-46d3-8d07-5b54c51f0d1c/","/groups/c3fc341e-fd3d-448d-bda2-daa4d52de451/","/groups/59cae23d-6bb1-488c-b27a-cd53e4c2969c/","/groups/2af2f04f-1eb3-4284-bcdf-ebeb7594ab9e/","/groups/0c64ab08-22b8-451a-bfea-44ae37088fec/","/groups/4c715a58-eab4-4823-aef2-0c0ed4fb8af5/","/groups/89a57350-8669-4193-a3da-eeee03b5c72d/","/groups/56d5e76e-c7b9-4629-8c52-a3bac3e4a35d/","/groups/b86f667b-652e-47e5-aa95-41d7a64ff38b/"],"description":"Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) is a heart muscle disease that consists in progressive dystrophy of primarily the right ventricular myocardium with fibro-fatty replacement and ventricular dilation, and that is clinically characterized by ventricular arrhythmias and a risk of sudden cardiac death.","associatedIndividuals":["/individuals/c76c9908-8633-4174-ae6f-7715050bab3c/","/individuals/dae16aac-d9df-4922-9322-338f54e2748b/","/individuals/a863d20b-4549-4751-87ef-fab1c6cce244/","/individuals/d81e322c-20ba-4d7e-8fae-f796538bbb91/","/individuals/256d781e-231b-4310-bbf0-e9ea506bd2c5/","/individuals/64e8b512-bc41-4e0e-9b1b-02addde63dab/","/individuals/6f098a98-87a5-47d4-a096-ed69c25bb028/","/individuals/0c73036c-aa23-471e-8631-30fae432119a/","/individuals/10edcdba-15f6-4048-b7b4-025074cb324d/","/individuals/6a876751-f696-4dc0-9a66-d902301082bc/"],"status":"in progress","@id":"/diseases/cd1c30fe-1089-4821-9fb1-1b630e828d99/","associatedInterpretations":["/interpretations/06a33c34-2d3d-4862-99c5-f81933dda3cf/","/interpretations/31b4ed40-d533-4f17-b0f5-2fb5470452f6/"],"uuid":"cd1c30fe-1089-4821-9fb1-1b630e828d99","associatedFamilies":["/families/55a55714-bab1-469d-852d-0fb37cede197/","/families/8b8861f7-b72c-4d0f-9191-30724d127ddb/","/families/572f864f-062c-4567-a5f4-29da77b0f327/","/families/9964a5d6-b5b1-40e4-b8aa-6fae77ef2ac8/","/families/e8903c10-53de-4e9b-81b0-d178fc85dac7/","/families/5bf5449f-9b4a-47f3-9266-e6fb089550d0/","/families/fd361567-cf74-4715-a9f6-44782ebe2ca7/","/families/af04519f-af9e-49ec-a290-0af3cd85e87c/","/families/222382ad-9289-4b66-b8c1-a945d8b6d644/"],"diseaseId":"MONDO_0016587","synonyms":["ARVC","ARVD","Right Ventricular Dysplasia","Arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia","arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia/cardiomyopathy","Arrhythmogenic RVD","arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia","ARVC cardiomyopathy"],"phenotypes":[],"last_modified":"2017-06-16T01:03:16.788277+00:00","modified_by":"/users/ac57e92b-f144-4b03-9d34-5c24b317e155/","associatedGdm":["/gdm/bab4804f-b258-4f21-85ea-1d0a355e9725/","/gdm/36a5a7df-f731-40bd-852f-19d24979a93e/","/gdm/8200c2b7-d0fe-4ed5-bb2a-ab5f28566a27/","/gdm/56045ff4-256d-437a-884f-34e077a57a85/","/gdm/da443dd4-1d44-4b7c-b3cb-6481af9cbcae/","/gdm/b34ded29-f1d5-4cca-a84a-0140b2460ef7/","/gdm/ee712c5b-a440-4ab3-b79a-42dd73e80d73/","/gdm/0a25f66d-9a61-4ee1-8a46-85e25fd22ef0/","/gdm/316ac2fc-555e-4c2e-a0ba-29a7e1663f72/","/gdm/2b9da339-e294-42d3-a0a7-caf0aef101a1/"],"term":"arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy"},"date_created":"2019-02-13T14:12:12.637820+00:00","modified_by":"/users/1cc648c0-3371-46c7-b00c-613483606da3/"}},"approvalStatus":"Approved","date_created":"2020-05-08T16:10:01.289031+00:00","modified_by":"/users/de63cd49-ce44-4514-8222-91145761f157/"}
