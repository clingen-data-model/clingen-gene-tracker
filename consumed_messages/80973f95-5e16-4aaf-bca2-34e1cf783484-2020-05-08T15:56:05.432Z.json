One of these patients died suddenly during a four years follow-up and autopsy revealed fibrofatty changes in the right ventricle, a decrease number of myocardial cells as typical features of ARVC. Genetic screening revealed a variant on SCN5A, however no further information about genomic localization and classification of the variant was present.\nThe second study (24388542) reported the case of a 50 year old female patient presenting an enlarged right ventricle with structural myocardial changes. Right ventricular angiography showed sacculations in the so-called triangle of dysplasia resembling ARVC structural changes. Genetic testing identified a loss-of-function variant on SCN5A, however no further information about genomic localization and classification of the variant was present.\nThe third study (18375968) reported the case of 58 years old man presenting monomorphic and polymorphic non-sustained ventricular tachycardias, chest pain and dyspnea at rest, complete RBBB, mild dilatation and hypokinesia of the right ventricular and bioptic investigation revealed cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis, but no myocardial tissue degeneration. Genetic screening identified a splice error on intron 21 of SCN5A gene c.3840+1 G>A, which results in a loss of function of the sodium channel. However, no segregation data were available and patient\u2019s phenotype does not fulfil a definite ARVC diagnosis.\nThe most recent study (28069705) investigated the entire exome for pathogenic variants among a \u2018discovery cohort\u2019 of six unrelated Caucasian patients with a clinical diagnosis of ARVC. Genetic screening identified a heterozygous SCN5A missense variant in a female patient causing the aminoacid substitution\nArg1898His. Subsequently, authors analysed a \u2018validation cohort\u2019 of 281 unrelated patients for SCN5A variants. Authors identified 5 different variants in 5 patients; among these a missense variant causing the aminoacid substitution Ser1787Asn was excluded due its high frequency in the general population. Two patients were digenic variants carriers, both presenting a different pathogenic variant on PKP2 and an additional variant on SCN5A. Another patient carried a heterozygous in frame deletion (Leu729del), however cascade genetic screening revealed that family members carrying this variants did not fulfill definite ARVC criteria. Finally genetic screening identified a missense variant Tyr416Cys in a 55 years old female but segregation study in the family don\u2019t demonstrate the link of this variant with the clinical phenotype.\nExperimental data from this last study (28069705) analyzed the role of SCN5A Arg1898His variant. \nAuthors generated an induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes and then corrected them by using CRISP/Cas9 technology. Whole-cell patch clamping revealed a 36% reduction in peak sodium current and super-resolution and fluorescence microscopy showed reduced abundance of both SCN5A and CDH2 clusters at the intercalated disc. However, experimental data do not showed the link of electrical abnormalities to structural changes typical of ARVC alterations such as myocardial fibrotic replacement. In summary, there is limited evidence to support gene-disease association. There is no clear evidence that the identified SCN5A variants contribute to the ARVC phenotype and there is no known disease mechanism that would link SCN5A with ARVC."}],"submitted_by":{"title":"Kalliopi

Four patients had a family history of heart disease. Basic ECGs showed sinus rhythm in all of them. PR interval was prolonged in one. Two patients had complete and one had incomplete right bundle branch block. One patient had inverted t waves in V1-3 and late potentials. Three had an upsloping ST-T segment elevation in V1-2. The cardiothoracic index was less than 0.5 in five and 0.50 in one. In one of the five patients studied, the clinical episode of ventricular fibrillation was reproduced by stimulation of the right ventricular outflow tract during electrophysiologic study. Results of cross-sectional echocardiography and angiography showed predominantly structural and wall motion abnormalities of the right ventricle in five patients and slight wall motion abnormalities of the left ventricle in two. Two patients also had mitral and tricuspid valve prolapse. Coronary arteries were normal in all five patients examined. Results of endomyocardial biopsy showed no abnormalities in one patient, fibrosis in two, and fibrolipomatosis in one. Two patients died during follow-up: autopsy was performed in one and results showed right ventricular cardiomyopathy. Thus in five of these selected patients with apparent idiopathic ventricular fibrillation, some abnormalities, predominantly of the right ventricle, were documented only after detailed investigation; however, clinical history and some nonspecific ECG abnormalities were factors in the diagnostic procedure.","date_created":"2018-11-07T13:30:50.106749+00:00","pmid":"2589161","modified_by":"/users/d3f2028f-38cf-425c-882e-eb46818d635c/"},"number_individual":"","modified_by":"/users/d3f2028f-38cf-425c-882e-eb46818d635c/","associatedGdm":["/gdm/46c906d4-635f-40d9-8555-a53c61938820/"],"number_family":""}],"gene":{"schema_version":"1","nameSynonyms":["long QT syndrome 3"],"previousNames":["sodium channel, voltage-gated, type V, alpha (long QT syndrome 3)","sodium channel, voltage-gated, type V, alpha subunit"],"@type":["gene","item"],"symbol":"SCN5A","@id":"/genes/SCN5A/","uuid":"e0d5a46b-c6b4-4308-b594-1e13cf427072","chromosome":"3p21","previousSymbols":["CMD1E"],"status":"current","synonyms":["Nav1.5","LQT3","HB1","HBBD","PFHB1","IVF","HB2","HH1","SSS1","CDCD2","CMPD2","ICCD"],"hgncId":"HGNC:10593","omimIds":["600163"],"entrezId":"6331","pmids":["7842012","15466643","16382098"],"name":"sodium channel, voltage gated, type V alpha subunit","locusType":"gene with protein product","hgncStatus":"Approved"},"omimId":"","actions":[{"title":"Edit","href":"/gdm/46c906d4-635f-40d9-8555-a53c61938820/#!edit","name":"edit","profile":"/profiles/gdm.json"},{"title":"Edit JSON","href":"/gdm/46c906d4-635f-40d9-8555-a53c61938820/#!edit-json","name":"edit-json","profile":"/profiles/gdm.json"}],"date_created":"2018-11-07T13:19:51.009728+00:00","modified_by":"/users/ea3554bc-c514-4ddb-b9d0-dcf04cfe9f34/"}},"approvalStatus":"Approved","date_created":"2020-01-24T02:18:02.018494+00:00","modified_by":"/users/de63cd49-ce44-4514-8222-91145761f157/"}
