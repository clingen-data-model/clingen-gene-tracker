    There does not appear to be an HGNC record for <a href="{{url('/#/curations/'.$curation['id'])}}">your curation {{$curation['id']}}</a> with gene symbol {{$curation['gene_symbol']}}.  
    <br>    
    This probably means that the gene symbol is not a valid HGNC symbol.  Please consult <a href="https://https://www.genenames.org/">HGNC</a> to find a valid gene symbol.
